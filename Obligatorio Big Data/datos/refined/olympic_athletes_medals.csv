Lindsey Jacobellis has become the top American female in boardercross, winning five gold medals in the event at Winter X through 2009, and a silver medal in 2007. She was the 2005 World Champion and Grand Prix Champion and was heavily favored to win the 2006 Olympic gold medal. A series of television commercials prior to the Torino Olympics focused on her pursuit of the SBX gold. In the final at Torino, Jacobellis was leading for most of the race, coming to the last jump with a three-second lead over Frieden. But Jacobellis then hot dogged it, going for a twisting grab, and fell. Frieden passed her for the gold medal, although Jacobellis was able to recover for the silver. Jacobellis noted, “Snowboarding is fun. I was having fun.” She has recovered to dominate the circuit in 2007-09, winning Winter X gold in 2008 and 2009.

Three-time world champions and four-time European champions, French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron had to settle for silver behind Canadian duo Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir at PyeongChang 2018. With age still very much on their side, the world record holders for the short dance, free dance and combined points totals are already planning their bid for gold at Beijing 2022.


A proud tradition


French figure skating has produced many a successful ice dance pair since the 1990s, led by 1991 world champions and Olympic silver medallists Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay.


The list also includes Gwendal Peizerat and Marina Anissina (2000 world champions and Salt Lake 2002 Olympic champions); Isabelle Delobbel and Olivier Schoenfelder (2008 world champions) and Nathalie Péchalat and Fabian Bourzat (two-time World Championship medallists and double European champions.)


Worthy successors


Aged only 22 and 23 respectively, Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron are well on the way to achieving even more than their illustrious predecessors, having already won three world and four continental titles in dominating the international scene since Sochi 2014.


As Cizeron explained: “Even though we’ve only just started our careers and we’re still pretty young, we’ve gone some way already to making our mark on skating. I hope there’s a lot more to come too.”


Perfect partners


Born on 10 May 1995 in Clermont-Ferrand, Papadakis first took to the ice at an early age thanks to her mother Catherine, a figure skating coach. Twenty-four-year-old Cizeron also received an early introduction to the sport through his father Marc, president of the Clermont Auvergne Ice Dance Club.


It was Papadakis’ mother, the pair’s first coach, who suggested they start skating together when Gabriella was around nine. The two quickly developed a strong rapport, training hard during their school years. “It comes naturally when you’re 12 and 13, and our first aim was to become champions of France,” explained Papadakis. “And when we took part in our first international competition, we wanted to finish first,” added Cizeron.


A sign of things to come


After excelling on the international stage at junior level and finishing second at the 2013 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Milan, despite Papadakis suffering from an ankle injury, the French pair made their senior debut in the 2013/14 season.


After placing 13th at their first Worlds in March 2014 they then relocated to Montreal to train. In November that same year they took their maiden major win at the ISU Grand Prix Cup of China in Shanghai and then lifted the Trophée de France in Paris.


Expressing their lofty ambitions, Papadakis said: “We want to innovate, to do things no one’s ever done before and take skating in a new direction.”


World and european doubles


At the 2015 European Championships in Stockholm (SWE), Papadakis and Cizeron scored highest in both the short programme and the free skate to land their first continental title. Two months later in Shanghai (CHN) the French pair added a maiden world title. Performing a stunning free skate to the sound of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 23, they scored 112.34 points to climb up from fourth after the short and take the gold.


“It was an intensely pleasurable experience, which was exactly what we wanted to achieve,” said Cizeron at the time. “We are only at the start of our careers and we weren’t really expecting this. Even we are amazed.”


They retained both titles in 2016, in Bratislava (SVK) in January and Boston (USA) in March, again thanks to outstanding performances in the free skate.


Bouncing back


In Montreal, Papadakis and Cizeron trained with Canadian 2010 Olympic champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. Returning from a two-year sabbatical, in December 2016 Virtue and Moir got the better of the French duo at the NHK Trophy in Sapporo (JAP), before beating them once again in the final of the ISU Grand Prix in Marseille (FRA). The defeats were the French pair’s first since the 2014/15 season.


Papadakis and Cizeron were back on top of the podium in January 2017 in Ostrava (CZE), winning their third straight European title by some distance over the Italians Anna Cappellini and Luca Lanotte and the Russians Ekaterina Bobrova and Dmitri Soloviev.


Two months later, however, Virtue and Moir beat them to gold again at the 2017 World Championships in Helsinki, giving the French pair plenty to ponder ahead of the Olympic season.


Record-breaking form


The main contenders for Olympic gold at PyeongChang 2018, the two pairs largely avoided each other on the ISU circuit in the lead-up to the Games. Papadakis and Cizeron became the first duo to break the 200-point barrier at the Cup of China on 4 November 2017 and two weeks later scored a world-record 120.58 in the free dance at the Internationaux de France.


On 9 December the Canadians and French eventually met at the Grand Prix in Nagoya (JAP), where Papadakis and Cizeron set a new combined points world record of 202.16, topping the standings in the short and the free ahead of Virtue and Moir, who totalled 199.86 points. 


Olympic runners-up and world champions


The Olympic showdown between ice dancing’s leading two teams began with Papadakis suffering a problem with her costume during the short programme, which ended with the French trailing their Canadian rivals by a point. It was a gap Papadakis and Cizeron were unable to close in the free, despite posting a new world record of 123.25 points. The reason for that was that Virtue and Moir turned in an equally sparkling performance to clinch their second Olympic title with a world record points total of 206.07, with the French just behind them on 205.28.


“We gave our all and I’m happy with what we achieved,” said Cizeron. “It was almost perfect and we can be proud of ourselves.”


A month later in Milan (ITA), Papadakis and Cizeron won their third world title, reaching new heights in the process, thanks to world records in the short (83.73 points), the free (123.47 points) and overall (207.20 points), putting them well clear of the USA’s Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue and Canada’s Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje.


“This isn’t revenge, because Virtue and Moir weren’t here,” said Cizeron afterwards. “Obviously we wanted to end the season on a high note, especially after what happened at the Games, where we didn’t get the medal we were looking for,” added Papadakis.


Next stop Beijing


The French pair are looking to add to their extensive collection of medals, already planning for their next bid for Olympic gold. “We’ll go again in four years’ time,” said Papadakis. “We’ll need to keep developing our style, though we’re not exactly sure what we’re going to do yet because we were focusing so hard on the Olympic season. We still have a lot of passion, though, and we still want to keep doing new things.


Cizeron added: “We’re going to try to keep moving forward with our dancing, with concepts, and keep trying to do daring things and take ice dancing in a modern and fresh direction.”

He was the hero of the 2017-2018 Olympic cross-country season: at age 21, Johannes Klaebo won three gold medals at PyeongChang 2018 to tie with French biathlete Martin Fourcade for the most gold medals won at the Games. The youngest Olympic champion in his sport, he also became, at the end of the season, the youngest winner of the big FIS Crystal Globe. Norway has a new star! 


On skis by the age of 2 


Johannes Høsflot Klaebo told his story to the FIS after winning his first Crystal Globe (in the sprint) at the end of the 2016-2017 season, his first on the World Cup circuit, during which he continued to compete at the junior level. ""I’m a 20-year old guy from Trondheim. I still live with my younger brother, sister and my parents. My granddad gave me my first pair of skis for Christmas when I was two. Apparently, I was skiing in our living room the whole day. My mum and dad love cross-country skiing, and when we were kids we used to ski a lot together. When I was a kid we spent many hours skiing and jumping. But what I loved most was football. I spent virtually all my time on the pitch and I was sure I would become a footballer."" 


A well-documented journey 


But in the end, growing up in a winter sports nation, it was through cross-country skiing that he would develop his sporting prowess. He participated in his first Junior World Championships in 2015 in Almaty (Kazakhstan), where he won two bronze medals, in the classic sprint and relay. In February 2016, in Râșnov (Romania) he competed in four events and won three gold medals: the freestyle sprint, the 10km classic and the relay. In the same season, he joined the World Cup circuit for the first time. In his second race at this level, in Ruka (Finland) in November 2016, he was on the podium: third in the sprint. He took his first World Cup title, again in the sprint, in Otepää (Estonia) on 18 February 2017, and finished the pre-Olympic season with a bang, winning the “minitour” of Quebec and the Crystal Globe for the sprint. In addition, at the beginning of the year, he started a “vlog” on his YouTube channel, through which he gives his fans – 60,000 subscribers, and some videos with over 200,000 views – a weekly insight into his life as a top-level athlete, by filming and commentating on his journeys across the snow-covered parts of the world. 


An Olympic winter at the top of the world


The young cross-country skier from Trondheim arrived at the PyeongChang Games with a formidable reputation. He was the sensation of the winter season, having already secured 12 wins and 19 podium finishes in 23 races on the World Cup circuit. He impressed audiences and his Norwegian team-mates alike, which included the winner of the overall standings of the last two FIS World Cups, Martin Jonhsrud Sundby. ""What Klaebo’s done during these three days is just incredible. He’s probably the best Norwegian cross-country skier we’ve ever had. This kid is worth the admission fee alone. Only Bjorn Daehlie and Petter Northug are still ahead of him. He’s the best in the world already,"" said Sundby in Ruka at the start of the cross-country winter season from 24 to 26 November 2017, and where Johannes left everyone else behind. He continued his dominant form by winning a total of seven victories before the end of the year, a feat which had never been achieved in just the first two months of the cross-country World Cup. By which point he had a healthy lead in the overall standings. 


The youngest Olympic champion in his sport 


On 11 February 2018, the 15km + 15km skiathlon, the first event to be contested in the Olympic Stadium in Alpensia, ended in an all Norwegian podium. Simen Hegstad Krueger took gold, with the silver going to Martin Johnsrud Sundby and the bronze to Hans Christer Hollund. Not in the mix, Johannes took 10th place. But 48 hours later in the sprint classic, he launched a strong attack on the final hill of the circuit to win in superb style and become, at the age of 21 and 114 days, the youngest cross-country Olympic champion of all time. ""I think there was an enormous amount of pressure from outside in these last two weeks, and to show that I am capable of winning here, it's just incredible,"" he explained. ""Of course, it is tough. It has been a few days since I had a good night's sleep. But now, I can relax and concentrate on the rest of the programme. But I am going to celebrate this now too."" And on the subject of his record as the youngest cross-country Olympic champion, he added: ""Yes, I heard that. It is certainly very cool. I just need to concentrate on what I have to do. And as the pressure can get to you, it is even better to win convincingly. It is just the first event, and I am impatient for the next ones!""


Team gold 


On 18 February, Johannes secured gold for Norway in the 4 x 10km relay. He raced the anchor leg of the relay, in which he left his team's final rival, the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR), Denis Spitsov, firmly behind with an unanswerable acceleration on the penultimate hill. Didrik Tønseth, Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Simen Hegstad Krueger, who were waiting in the finish area to celebrate with their team-mate, were completely stunned. ""Many of our skiers could have competed in this relay. We are just grateful to be here, and to be able to go after the gold. On the final lap, I was feeling strong. Also in my first lap, and my skis were well prepared so I knew that I could attack at that moment, on the penultimate hill. I was feeling strong and managed to increase the gap; it was an incredible feeling,"" explained the hero of the day. Three days later, there was another gold to contest in the team sprint free. Johannes and Sundby left no room for suspense. It was the younger of the two who finished the job with a significant lead over the OAR and French duos. There were only two triple Olympic champions at PyeongChang 2018: the French biathlete Martin Fourcade and Johannes Høsflot Klaebo! 


""This guy inspires me,"" said Sundby. ""He only came in last season and in this season, maybe showing us how modern cross-country skiing should be. He is a talent that everybody can see for themselves, but he is only 21 years old. I may have one or two bits of advice to give him over the next few years, but for sure he has taken cross-country skiing to another level.""


The icing on the cake 


After his achievements in Korea, the Norwegian phenomenon still had a task to finish: win the FIS Crystal Globe. Although he reported on his vlog that he was having difficulty motivating himself, and was particularly tired, he mustered up what mental and physical strength he had left for the final events in Lahti (Finland), Drammen and Olso (Norway) and finally Falun (Sweden), and with his 14th victory of the winter – the sprint in Falun on 16 March – became the youngest ever winner of the overall standings in the history of the cross-country skiing World Cup. ""This season has been completely crazy. And now, I am impatient for the next one to begin,"" he said. This roaring start to the young Norwegian's career is just the prologue to what promises to be a tremendous sporting journey at the very highest level.

Francesco Friedrich cemented his reputation as one of the greatest bobsleigh pilots in history at Beijing 2022 by retaining his Olympic titles in the two-man and four-man bob.


Born in Pirna in Saxony, Friedrich - commonly known as ""Franz"" - switched from athletics to bobsleigh at 16. His older brother, David, was his pusher until his career was hampered by injury.


He won two-man gold and four-man silver at the 2011 World Junior Championships in Park City, Utah. Two weeks later, Friedrich was 11th in the two-man bob at his first senior World Championships in Koenigsee and claimed gold in the mixed team event featuring bobsleigh and skeleton athletes.


The young driver joined the IBSF World Cup circuit the following year and finished fourth at the World Championships before securing his first World Cup win at Altenburg in January 2013.


Later that month, while still only 22, he became the youngest world champion driver with victory in the two-man bob with brakeman Jannis Baecker.


Friedrich's first Olympic season proved to be a disappointment as he failed to add to his two World Cup wins and only finished sixth in the two-man and eighth in the four-man at Sochi 2014.


But that setback only served to spur him on to a reign of dominance at World Cups and World Championships.


After Friedrich's second world two-man bob title in 2015, coach Gerd Leopold said, ""Franz is a talent that you only see once every hundred years. He has everything needed to make bobsleigh history over the years to come; he is capable of putting his failures behind him and drawing astute conclusions from them.""


His charge has certainly lived up to that lofty billing, winning seven consecutive two-man world titles and four straight four-man crowns.


Friedrich also achieved success on the biggest stage of all, although victory in the two-man bob appeared unlikely after the first day with he and Thorsten Margis lying in fifth place overnight.


But a track record in heat three and the quickest time on the fourth and final run saw the pair tie for gold with Canada's Justin Kripps and Alex Kopacz.


It was not the first time Friedrich had shared the spoils. A year earlier, he and fellow German Johannes Lochner clocked identical aggregate times in the World Championship four-man bob event.


He said afterwards, ""It's really crazy! There were 0.06 seconds between us and we thought that the Canadians were going to win, or that it could end in a draw. I was hoping that it would end like that, and that it would be like at the World Championships in the fours last year, and that's what happened. Fantastic! We have worked so many years for this!""


That was just the start. In the four-man, Friedich - with Margis, Candy Bauer and Martin Grothkopp - dominated from the start with the fastest time in each of the first three heats making the fourth run a victory cruise. They finished over half a second clear of the chasing pack to make Friedrich the sixth bobsleigh pilot to complete the two-man and four-man double at the same Games.


That Olympic triumph was backed up by near-total supremacy with Friedrich taking his World Cup wins tally to 44 in two-man and 22 in four-man.


He was the hot favourite for both events at Beijing 2022 and promptly delivered.


Together with Margis again in the two-man, Friedrich set track records in heats one and three on his way to victory by over Lochner by almost half a second.


Lochner set a track record in the opening heat of the four-man, but Friedrich - with Margis, Bauer and Alexander Schueller - was quickest on each of the next three runs to complete an unprecedented double-double of bobsleigh titles.


Only Andre Lange had previously retained the two-man (2006, 2010) and four-man titles (2002, 2006) but Friedrich is the first to do the double twice at the same Games.


He said, ""We are so happy, and the boys did an amazing job. All those in the background helped us. Without that, it would be not possible to do this.


""I'm lucky that what I'm doing is my job, it's what I love. There's only so much time you have in life that you can perform sport at this level. We take every day, every hour and every second to work flat out to do the best we can.""


Friedrich's attention to detail is legendary. The team is also involved in a bakery in his home region of Saxony with some of the proceeds used to fund the team.


The bobsleigh legend will be 33 at Milano Cortina 2026 where he could add more gold to his already brilliant legacy.

Born October 10, 1984 American Elana Meyers Taylor is the definition of bobsleigh royalty.


At Beijing 2022 the California native confirmed her status as such when, age 37, she won a silver in the women's inaugural monobob competition and bronze in the two-person bobsleigh with brakewoman Sylvia Hoffman to become the most decorated Black athlete in the history of the Winter Olympics.


With her two medals from the Chinese capital the American now sits on a total of five Olympic medals - three silver and two bronze - meaning that in five races, at four Olympics, she has never finished off the podium.


Her success in the Chinese capital comes off the back of a career where Meyers Taylor has achieved almost everything her sport has to offer.


It all started at the 2009 World Championships, where she piloted to silver in the two-woman event alongside Shauna Rohbock in Lake Placid, USA.


That performance helped Meyers Taylor get selected for the USA at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, where she finished with a bronze medal. Another world silver followed at the 2013 world champs in St. Moritz, Switzerland, alongside brakewoman Katie Eberling.


The 2014 season turned out to be a significant turning point for Meyers Taylor on several levels.


Firstly, the American partnered up with Lauryn Williams to win Olympic silver at Sochi 2014. It was also the season where the IBSF announced it would allow mix-gender crews to compete in 4-person bobsleigh, and on 8 November, she piloted a four-person crew to third place in the US trials, securing a place to compete for the US national team with only having four day of experience in a four-person sled.


On November 15, 2014, Meyers Taylor partnered her husband and fellow bobsleigh athlete Nic Taylor to become the first women (alongside Kaillie Humphries) to compete with and against men in an international four-person bobsleigh competition, in the season-opening North American Cup race in Park City, Utah.


Another huge first saw Meyers Taylor secure her - and the United States' - first two-woman world title in 2015 at Winterberg, Germany, alongside pusher Cherrelle Garrett. It was a feat she would go on to repeat at the 2017 Worlds, where she claimed gold again this time, with Kehri Jones.


Meyers Taylor then went on to win her third Olympic medal at the PyeongChang 2018 Games, this time with Lauren Gibbs as brakewoman. Little did she know then, that with the inclusion of the monobob event - something she and Humphries had passionately been advocating for for years - that by the next Olympic cycle would become a sporting legend.


Taylor's talents also extend beyond the snow. She attended George Washington University on a softball scholarship, and in 2014 represented the USA women's rugby sevens team at the China Women's Sevens. She has also served as president of the Women's Sports Foundation, empowering future female athletes.

A trap shooter, Alessandra Perilli began shooting when she was 15. She won her first international medal at the 2008 European Junior Games in Nicosia, winning a bronze medal.

At the 2010 World Championships Perilli helped San Marino win a bronze in the women’s team trap shooting event, and in 2013 she helped the San Marino mixed trap team to a bronze at the European Games, accompanying Manuel Mancini. Perilli has won several medals at the World Cup, including, through 2015, two golds, two silvers, and a bronze medal. At London in 2012 she posted the best Olympic finish ever by a Sammarinese athlete when she finished fourth in women’s trap shooting, just missing the podium in a shoot-off.

At just fourteen years and three months old, Tom Daley was the youngest British Olympian since rowing coxswain Ken Lester, when he competed at the Beijing Olympics. Daley, who began diving at the age of seven, won the British national junior (under-18) platform title in 2004 just a few days after his tenth birthday. In 2007 he became the youngest ever winner of a British senior title when he took the individual platform event and the following years retained his title and added the synchronised event with partner Blake Aldridge. In March 2008 he scored a surprise victory at the European Championships in Eindhoven to become the youngest ever European champion in either swimming or diving. After Beijing he claimed two silver medals at the 2008 World Junior Championships, before winning the senior World Championship in 2009 at the age of 15. Daley won two gold medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, in the 10-metre individual and synchronized event with Max Brick. He competed in his second Olympics in 2012 and won an individual bronze medal. After the London Games, he gained celebrity status and hosted his own TV show entitled Splash! 


Daley won a second successive Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2014, and also a silver, in the synchronized event with James Denny. The following year Daley won the inaugural team event at the World Championship with Rebecca Gallantree and ay Rio in 2016, Daley won a second Olympic bronze medal, with Daniel Goodfellow in the synchronized event. In qualifying for the semi-finals in the individual competition with a new Olympic record, Daley was clear favourite to make the final and collect a third Olympic medal. However, he had a succession of disastrous dives, and was eliminated.

The inaugural curling mixed doubles event at the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 was won by an ad hoc yet rock solid pairing of two Winnipeg-born Canadian Olympic champions, Kaitlyn Lawes and John Morris. After a loss to Norway in the event's opening fixture, the Canadians dominated Switzerland's Jenny Perret and Martin Rios in the final. Lawes and Morris are the first Canadian Olympic doubles curling champions in history.


They were born on the same day, in the same place, but not in the same year. Fate brought the two Winnipeg natives (Manitoba Province) together at the PyeongChang 2018 Games to win the first gold medal in curling mixed doubles, one of the four new events introduced during this edition of the Winter Games.


Half an hour of training 


Canada dominates the sport at international level, but, curiously, has never won the world title in mixed doubles in the ten years it has been contested since 2008. For the first appearance of the event on the Olympic programme, Canada decided to select its team through trials held in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. John Morris, a very experienced player, normally pairs with Rachel Homan, who had just been selected as captain of Canada's women's team for PyeongChang. Left without a partner, John decided to call on an old friend, Kaitlyn Lawes. They were both born on 16 December in Manitoba, John in 1978 and Kaitlyn in 1988. Before defeating the other candidates in the first step of their Olympic journey, the pair had trained together for only half an hour in Winnipeg, their home town. ""I had already played with her in the Continental Cup,"" John recalled. ""We've been good friends and she's a heck of a shot-maker.""


Kaitlyn Lawes, gold in 2014 dedicated to her father 


Kaitlyn certainly did not lack experience before teaming up with John. It was family tradition that led her to start curling at the age of four. As team captain, she had an exceptional junior career, winning two national titles in 2008 and 2009, and two consecutive World Championship medals, bronze then silver. Her first national title was particularly significant because she won it a few months after the death of her father, which had led her to consider ending her curling career. In the end, she found the strength to continue her journey. From 2011, she joined the team captained by Jennifer Jones as a third, and the results quickly began to stack up at national level. In 2013, the team was selected for the 2014 Sochi Games, where they would go on to put in an exceptional performance. The Canadians got through the round robin phase undefeated and became the first team to be crowned Olympic champions without losing a single match. ""I thought about my dad a lot during the tournament,"" Kaitlyn revealed. ""He was my inspiration.""


The title with Kevin Martin in 2010 for John Morris 


John also grew up with the sport. His father, Earle Morris, is the inventor of the curling “Stabiliser”, used by a large number of players. Soon after John's birth in Manitoba, the Morris family moved to Ottawa (Ontario), where John quickly demonstrated his talent for curling. He was enormously successful at junior level, even winning the Junior World Championship title twice as captain. He continued his career at Wilfried Laurier University in Ontario. His sport then took him to Calgary (Alberta), but it was his next move, joining Kevin Martin's team, that would prove particularly fruitful. Following successes at national level, the team represented Canada at the World Championships in Grand Forks in 2008, where they beat Scotland in the final to take the title. In 2009, they earned the honour of representing their country on Canadian soil at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games the following year. They gave their home fans plenty to cheer about by dominating the round robin phase and winning the Olympic title 6-3 against a Norwegian team skipped by Thomas Ulsrud.


The Korean gold 


After the hard-earned victory in the Canadian trials, Kaitlyn and John headed to Korea full of ambition. The tournament began even before the Opening Ceremony. The rapid format, with six stones instead of eight in each end, left the potential for scorelines to quickly swing in the favour of one team, as was the case when the Canadian duo lost to Norway in their first match. But from this point on, the team's performance was flawless. Their teamwork and talent led them to take six wins in a row in the round robin phase. In the semi-finals, a second meeting with Norway ended in a comfortable victory of 8-4 to the Canadians. They met Switzerland – holders of the World Championship title – in the final, and very quickly asserted their dominance. Switzerland's Martin Rios made a mistake in the third end and Kaitlyn took the opportunity to secure four points. The Swiss pair, unable to come back, were forced to accept defeat at 10-3 after six ends. Canada became the first team to win mixed doubles curling at the Winter Games and Kaitlyn and John became the first Canadian Olympic doubles curling champions of all time.

Three-time world champions and four-time European champions, French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron had to settle for silver behind Canadian duo Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir at PyeongChang 2018. With age still very much on their side, the world record holders for the short dance, free dance and combined points totals are already planning their bid for gold at Beijing 2022.


A proud tradition


French figure skating has produced many a successful ice dance pair since the 1990s, led by 1991 world champions and Olympic silver medallists Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay.


The list also includes Gwendal Peizerat and Marina Anissina (2000 world champions and Salt Lake 2002 Olympic champions); Isabelle Delobbel and Olivier Schoenfelder (2008 world champions) and Nathalie Péchalat and Fabian Bourzat (two-time World Championship medallists and double European champions.)


Worthy successors


Aged only 22 and 23 respectively, Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron are well on the way to achieving even more than their illustrious predecessors, having already won three world and four continental titles in dominating the international scene since Sochi 2014.


As Cizeron explained: “Even though we’ve only just started our careers and we’re still pretty young, we’ve gone some way already to making our mark on skating. I hope there’s a lot more to come too.”


Perfect partners


Born on 10 May 1995 in Clermont-Ferrand, Papadakis first took to the ice at an early age thanks to her mother Catherine, a figure skating coach. Twenty-four-year-old Cizeron also received an early introduction to the sport through his father Marc, president of the Clermont Auvergne Ice Dance Club.


It was Papadakis’ mother, the pair’s first coach, who suggested they start skating together when Gabriella was around nine. The two quickly developed a strong rapport, training hard during their school years. “It comes naturally when you’re 12 and 13, and our first aim was to become champions of France,” explained Papadakis. “And when we took part in our first international competition, we wanted to finish first,” added Cizeron.


A sign of things to come


After excelling on the international stage at junior level and finishing second at the 2013 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Milan, despite Papadakis suffering from an ankle injury, the French pair made their senior debut in the 2013/14 season.


After placing 13th at their first Worlds in March 2014 they then relocated to Montreal to train. In November that same year they took their maiden major win at the ISU Grand Prix Cup of China in Shanghai and then lifted the Trophée de France in Paris.


Expressing their lofty ambitions, Papadakis said: “We want to innovate, to do things no one’s ever done before and take skating in a new direction.”


World and european doubles


At the 2015 European Championships in Stockholm (SWE), Papadakis and Cizeron scored highest in both the short programme and the free skate to land their first continental title. Two months later in Shanghai (CHN) the French pair added a maiden world title. Performing a stunning free skate to the sound of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 23, they scored 112.34 points to climb up from fourth after the short and take the gold.


“It was an intensely pleasurable experience, which was exactly what we wanted to achieve,” said Cizeron at the time. “We are only at the start of our careers and we weren’t really expecting this. Even we are amazed.”


They retained both titles in 2016, in Bratislava (SVK) in January and Boston (USA) in March, again thanks to outstanding performances in the free skate.


Bouncing back


In Montreal, Papadakis and Cizeron trained with Canadian 2010 Olympic champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. Returning from a two-year sabbatical, in December 2016 Virtue and Moir got the better of the French duo at the NHK Trophy in Sapporo (JAP), before beating them once again in the final of the ISU Grand Prix in Marseille (FRA). The defeats were the French pair’s first since the 2014/15 season.


Papadakis and Cizeron were back on top of the podium in January 2017 in Ostrava (CZE), winning their third straight European title by some distance over the Italians Anna Cappellini and Luca Lanotte and the Russians Ekaterina Bobrova and Dmitri Soloviev.


Two months later, however, Virtue and Moir beat them to gold again at the 2017 World Championships in Helsinki, giving the French pair plenty to ponder ahead of the Olympic season.


Record-breaking form


The main contenders for Olympic gold at PyeongChang 2018, the two pairs largely avoided each other on the ISU circuit in the lead-up to the Games. Papadakis and Cizeron became the first duo to break the 200-point barrier at the Cup of China on 4 November 2017 and two weeks later scored a world-record 120.58 in the free dance at the Internationaux de France.


On 9 December the Canadians and French eventually met at the Grand Prix in Nagoya (JAP), where Papadakis and Cizeron set a new combined points world record of 202.16, topping the standings in the short and the free ahead of Virtue and Moir, who totalled 199.86 points. 


Olympic runners-up and world champions


The Olympic showdown between ice dancing’s leading two teams began with Papadakis suffering a problem with her costume during the short programme, which ended with the French trailing their Canadian rivals by a point. It was a gap Papadakis and Cizeron were unable to close in the free, despite posting a new world record of 123.25 points. The reason for that was that Virtue and Moir turned in an equally sparkling performance to clinch their second Olympic title with a world record points total of 206.07, with the French just behind them on 205.28.


“We gave our all and I’m happy with what we achieved,” said Cizeron. “It was almost perfect and we can be proud of ourselves.”


A month later in Milan (ITA), Papadakis and Cizeron won their third world title, reaching new heights in the process, thanks to world records in the short (83.73 points), the free (123.47 points) and overall (207.20 points), putting them well clear of the USA’s Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue and Canada’s Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje.


“This isn’t revenge, because Virtue and Moir weren’t here,” said Cizeron afterwards. “Obviously we wanted to end the season on a high note, especially after what happened at the Games, where we didn’t get the medal we were looking for,” added Papadakis.


Next stop Beijing


The French pair are looking to add to their extensive collection of medals, already planning for their next bid for Olympic gold. “We’ll go again in four years’ time,” said Papadakis. “We’ll need to keep developing our style, though we’re not exactly sure what we’re going to do yet because we were focusing so hard on the Olympic season. We still have a lot of passion, though, and we still want to keep doing new things.


Cizeron added: “We’re going to try to keep moving forward with our dancing, with concepts, and keep trying to do daring things and take ice dancing in a modern and fresh direction.”

Papadakis and Cizeron became the first duo to break the 200-point barrier at the Cup of China on 4 November 2017 and two weeks later scored a world-record 120.58 in the free dance at the Internationaux de France.


On 9 December the Canadians and French eventually met at the Grand Prix in Nagoya (JAP), where Papadakis and Cizeron set a new combined points world record of 202.16, topping the standings in the short and the free ahead of Virtue and Moir, who totalled 199.86 points. 


Olympic runners-up and world champions


The Olympic showdown between ice dancing’s leading two teams began with Papadakis suffering a problem with her costume during the short programme, which ended with the French trailing their Canadian rivals by a point. It was a gap Papadakis and Cizeron were unable to close in the free, despite posting a new world record of 123.25 points. The reason for that was that Virtue and Moir turned in an equally sparkling performance to clinch their second Olympic title with a world record points total of 206.07, with the French just behind them on 205.28.


“We gave our all and I’m happy with what we achieved,” said Cizeron. “It was almost perfect and we can be proud of ourselves.”


A month later in Milan (ITA), Papadakis and Cizeron won their third world title, reaching new heights in the process, thanks to world records in the short (83.73 points), the free (123.47 points) and overall (207.20 points), putting them well clear of the USA’s Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue and Canada’s Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje.


“This isn’t revenge, because Virtue and Moir weren’t here,” said Cizeron afterwards. “Obviously we wanted to end the season on a high note, especially after what happened at the Games, where we didn’t get the medal we were looking for,” added Papadakis.


Next stop Beijing


The French pair are looking to add to their extensive collection of medals, already planning for their next bid for Olympic gold. “We’ll go again in four years’ time,” said Papadakis. “We’ll need to keep developing our style, though we’re not exactly sure what we’re going to do yet because we were focusing so hard on the Olympic season. We still have a lot of passion, though, and we still want to keep doing new things.


Cizeron added: “We’re going to try to keep moving forward with our dancing, with concepts, and keep trying to do daring things and take ice dancing in a modern and fresh direction.”

Over the course of three appearances at the Olympic Winter Games, Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla has become her country’s most successful female cross-country skier of all time. Curiously, she has won two of her three golds and one of her six silvers on the very same day, 15 February, at four-year intervals.


Red letter day


15 February has a talismanic significance in the life of Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla. It was on that very day in 2010 that she made her Olympic debut, in the 10km freestyle in Vancouver. Starting 31st, she simply blew the rest of the field away, leading at every split and finishing a full 6.6 seconds clear of the defending champion, Kristina Smigun-Vaehi of Estonia, and more than 15 seconds ahead of Norway’s Marit Bjørgen.


Kalla’s victory opened Sweden’s gold medal account at Vancouver and she became the country’s first individual cross-country skiing champion at the Winter Games since Grenoble 1968, when Toini Gustafsson collected two golds.


Four years to the day later, 26-year-old Kalla found herself anchoring for Sweden in the 4x5km relay at Sochi, in a team that also featured Ida Ingemarsdotter, Emma Wiken and Anna Haag. By the time she took over from Haag, Kalla had a 27-second deficit to make up on Finland and Germany, with Krista Lahteenmaki and Denise Hermann fighting it out for the lead on the last leg.


Finding some searing pace, Kalla caught up with the two frontrunners at the top of the last climb and then burst clear to be embraced by her ecstatic team-mates at the finish line. In tribute to her stunning performance, Pajala Airport – situated in her native province of Norrbotten – changed its name to Kalla International Airport that same day.


Five days after claiming the first gold of PyeongChang 2018 with a majestic display in the 15km skiathlon, Kalla continued her happy knack of winning Olympic medals on 15 February. On this occasion she picked up a silver in the 10km freestyle, finishing 20 seconds behind Norway’s Ragnhild Haga and a little over 10 seconds clear of joint bronze medallists Bjørgen and Krista Parmakoski of Finland. In doing so, Kalla became the first skier to win three consecutive medals in the event.


Nine olympic medals


Hailing from the northern village of Tarendö, where she took up her sport at the age of seven, Kalla had taken her haul of Olympic medals to nine by the time she left the Republic of Korea (three golds and six silvers). As well as joining fellow cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg as her country’s most decorated Winter Olympian, Kalla is also Sweden’s most successful female Olympian of all time.


Aside from the two golds she won at her first two Olympic Games, Kalla claimed three silvers: in the team sprint with Anna Haag at Vancouver 2010, and the 15km skiathlon and 10km classical at Sochi 2014. Her two other visits to the second step of the podium came in PyeongChang, alongside Anna Haag, Ebba Andersson and Stina Nilsson in the 4x5km, and with Nilsson again in a thrilling team sprint won by the USA.


Sweden’s undisputed number one


“I got the hang of cross-country skiing straightaway,” said Kalla, discussing her love for her sport. “The lifestyle of a skier and the fact you have to train twice a day is no sacrifice for me. It’s something I love, something I look for, every day and all year round.”


After winning the world junior skiathlon title in Kranj (SLO) in February 2006, Kalla quickly established herself as Sweden’s leading cross-country skier. Her many triumphs outside the Olympic arena include an FIS Tour de Ski crown in 2008, the Nordic Opening in 2018, a world team spring crown with Ida Ingemarsdotter in Oslo in 2011, and a world 10km freestyle gold won on home snow in Falun in 2015.


Her total of 12 World Championship medals includes four consecutive 4x5km relay silvers between 2011 and 2017. In the World Cup, meanwhile, she has amassed no fewer than 55 individual podium finishes – 11 of them wins, as of the end of the 2017/18 season – and 11 top-three finishes in team events.


“I’m living my dream by having the privilege of taking part in sport full time,” said the Swedish legend, who at the age of 30 has yet to contemplate the end of her career and may yet make a fourth Olympic appearance at Beijing 2022.

Winning more medals than any other athlete at PyeongChang 2018, five in total, Norwegian cross-country skiing idol Marit Bjørgen became the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, with a collection of 15 medals to her name. Eight of them are golds, equalling the record held by her compatriots Ole Einar Bjørndalen and Bjørn Daehlie, who won their titles in biathlon and cross-country respectively. Those records are just two of the many she has achieved during her remarkable career.


It started with the sprint


Bjørgen has won everything there is to win since embarking on her international career as a 19-year-old in 1999. The first of her 15 Olympic medals was a silver in the women’s 4x5km team relay at Salt Lake City 2002, when she formed part of a Norwegian quartet also featuring Bente Skari, Helde Pedersen and Anita Moan.


Bjørgen secured her maiden FIS World Cup win later that year in the freestyle sprint in Dusseldorf (GER), while a maiden world title came her way the following year in the same event in Val di Fiemme (ITA).


Though she started out as a sprint specialist and scored her first ten career wins in the freestyle and classical events thanks to her explosive power, Bjørgen expanded her repertoire to longer distances during the 2004/05 season, with yet more victories and podium finishes coming her way.


The greatest record in cross-country skiing


The Norwegian great added to her World Championship medal collection by pocketing three golds, a silver and a bronze in Oberstdorf (GER) in 2005. She followed up with four golds and a silver in Oslo-Holmenkollen (NOR) in 2011, a haul she repeated in Val di Fiemme two years later and to which she added two golds and a silver in Falun (SWE) in 2015 and four golds in Lahti in 2017. By end of her career she had amassed 26 World Championship medals, 18 of them golds.


She was just as prolific in the World Cup, taking the overall title in 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2015, winning six small crystal globes and amassing 184 top-three finishes, including 114 individual wins – another outright record. Remarkably, however, it was not until Vancouver 2010 that she won her first Olympic gold.


Medal rush in Vancouver


After a disappointing Turin 2006, where stomach pains restricted her to just the one medal – a silver in the 10km classical – Bjørgen bounced back in style at the Whistler Olympic Park four years later, climbing on to the podium in every event she entered.


She began with bronze in the 10km freestyle and then won three golds in a row (in the sprint, the 15km pursuit and the 4x5km team relay) before taking silver in the 30km classical, an event in which she finished just 0.3 seconds behind Poland’s Justyna Kowalczyk.


That impressive haul made her the most successful female athlete of the XXI Olympic Winter Games and led to her also collecting the Holmenkollen Medal, the highest distinction Nordic skiing has to offer.


More gold in Sochi


Her form undimmed by the time Sochi 2014 came around, the Norwegian successfully defended her Olympic 15km pursuit title and then partnered Ingvild Flugstad Ostberg to gold in the women’s team sprint.


She saved the best till last, getting the better of compatriots Therese Johaug and Kristin Stormer Steira to win the blue riband 30km freestyle event at her fourth attempt.


In winning her tenth Olympic medal, the Norwegian equalled the Soviet Union’s Raisa Smetanina and Italy’s Stefania Belmondo, both of them cross-country skiers. And in claiming her six Olympic title, she pulled level with the cross-country skier Lyubov Yegorova and the speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova (both of whom represented the former Soviet Union) as the most prolific female gold medallists in the history of the Winter Games.


The owner of more golds than Smetanina and Belmondo and more medals than Yegorova and Skoblikova, Bjoergen also became the most decorated female Winter Olympian of all time.


World Cup grand slam


Bjørgen began the 2014/15 FIS World Cup season by winning the one event absent from her extensive list of career honours: the Tour de Ski, the first leg of a World Cup grand slam that she completed by winning the distance and sprint crystal globes and the Nordic Opening title. Not surprisingly, the season ended with the Norwegian collecting her fourth big crystal globe.


Speaking on Norwegian TV in April 2015, Bjørgen announced that she was taking time out for a very good reason: “I have a little bombshell to drop here today: I’m going to be a mother in December. I plan to come back, though. My goal is the World Championships in Lahti.


On 26 December that year, she and partner Fred Borre Lundberg, the two-time Olympic Nordic combined champion, celebrated the arrival of a baby boy, Marius.


Going out on a high 


Bjørgen made the best possible return to the competitive arena at the 2017 World Championships in Lahti (FIN), winning the 10km classic, 15km skiathlon, 30km freestyle and the 4x5km relay with her Norwegian team-mates.


Though she was fast approaching 38, the medals kept coming her way at PyeongChang 2018, where she lived up to her nickname of “Gull Marit” (“Golden Marit”). She kicked off her fifth Olympic Winter Games with a silver in the skiathlon on the day after the Opening Ceremony, finishing seven seconds behind Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla.


Bjørgen then shared bronze with Finland’s Krista Parmakoski in a 10km freestyle race won by her compatriot Ragnhild Haga. In the 4x5km relay two days later, she skied a storming anchor leg to beat Sweden’s Stina Nilsson in a thrilling finish to claim gold for Norway and the seventh Olympic title of her career.


In her penultimate outing of the Games, she joined forces with Maiken Caspersen Falla to win bronze in a free sprint won by the USA. Then, on the final day of competition, Bjørgen broke clear of the field after 10km of the 30km classical to collect a joint-record eighth Olympic gold, putting her level with two other Norwegians: biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen and cross-country skier Bjørn Daehlie.


With her five medals, “Queen Marit” was the most decorated athlete of PyeongChang 2018, while her overall haul of 15 Olympic medals is two more than previous record holder Bjørndalen managed.


She also became the third most successful Olympian of all time – Summer and Winter – behind US swimmer Michael Phelps (28 medals, including 23 golds) and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina (18 medals, including nine golds). 


Legacy and retirement


“It’s incredible when I look back and see what I’ve done,” she said after her commanding 30km win. “I’ve had a wonderful career. These are my last Games and to finish off like this is just fantastic.”


Contemplating the legacy she would leave on hanging up her skis, Bjørgen said: “The future is bright for Norway, with more and more young athletes making it to the top. I also think that the reason why we’re so strong is that they have idols who’ve shown the way and who they can identify with. After these Games, we’re perhaps going to see more boys and girls coming through. If they’re doing cross-country or something else like Alpine skiing or skating, then it’s all good for the future.”


Bjørgen made the last competitive appearance of her stellar career at the Norwegian Championships on 6 April 2018, announcing that at the age of 38 she no longer had the motivation “to compete 100% for another season”. While her host of records will surely stand for a long time, her influence on her sport will endure even longer.

Sochi 2014 Olympic sprint champion and three-time reigning world champion, Norwegian cross-country skier Maiken Caspersen Falla will be looking to defend her title at her third Olympic Winter games at PyeongChang 2018. 


                                    Norway’s Maiken Caspersen Falla has proven herself to be a worthy successor to the great Marit Bjørgen, a ten-time Olympic gold medallist. She proved that at Sochi 2014, kicking on to win the sprint gold after defending champion Bjørgen fell in the semi-finals. The 2017 FIS Nordic Ski World Championships in Lahti (FIN) saw a repeat scenario, as Bjørgen won four golds but took a tumble in the sprint quarter-finals and could only look on as her fellow countrywoman – 10 years her junior – took another title from her. Strong both in classic and freestyle techniques, Falla’s tactic of choice is to hit the front early and stay there. Her aggressive game plan worked to perfection on both occasions, as she used her considerable power to surge past her opponents and hold the lead all the way to the line. Gifted sprinter Born in Lørenskog in south-east Norway on 13 August 1990, Falla and her twin brother Marius grew up playing a variety of sports, from snowboarding, Alpine skiing, ski jumping, biathlon and cross-country skiing to running, athletics, cycling and handball. Encouraged to always do her best, Falla was already beating the boys on skis and keeping pace with her brother when she was eight. On turning 15, she moved to the ski resort of Hovden to continue her sports studies. Olympic debutA brilliant junior at both national and international level, Falla made her World Cup debut in November 2008 at the age of 18. Her first podium, a third place finish in Dusseldorf (GER), came a month later in only her second World Cup race. Aged 19, she then earned selection for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games where she reached the quarter-finals of the classic sprint, an event won by Bjørgen. Establishing herself as a regular in Norway’s team sprint line-up, Falla won her first race alongside Bjørgen in Liberec (CZE) in January 2011. Norwegian one-two


The up-and-coming Norwegian cemented her status as a leading sprinter by finishing third in the classic at the 2013 World Championships in Val di Fiemme (ITA). A year later, she topped that by winning the Olympic freestyle sprint gold in Sochi. “It’s just amazing,” she said after leading her former junior team-mate Ingvild Flugstad Østberg over the line for a Norwegian one-two in Russia. “I still can’t believe I’ve done it. I’ve been dreaming of this since I was three.” 


Four world titlesAt the 2015 World Championships a year later in Falun (SWE) Falla once again won classic sprint bronze behind Bjørgen, then went on to join forces with Østberg and land her first world title, in the team sprint. To add to her growing list of honours, Falla won the 2015/16 sprint crystal globe after scoring four wins over the course of the season – two in each style. Then, in February 2017, came her first individual world title in the sprint in Lahti, where, along with Heidi Weng, she also won a second team sprint crown, crushing the competition to win by 5.56 seconds over Russia in silver and 18.39 seconds from the USA in bronze. Falla won a further world gold in the 4x5km relay, leading out a quartet also comprising Weng, Astrid Jacobsen and Bjørgen, with the Norwegians winning by over a minute from Sweden and Finland to secure their country’s 100th Nordic Ski World Championship gold. One to watch at PyeongChang 2018


Expectations are high for Falla at her third Winter Games in PyeongChang 2018, when she will have a sprint title to defend as well as potentially going for gold in the team sprint and relay events. Discussing her training regime, Falla said: “I live and train at the right quantity and quality every single day, for only providing world-class results! I know myself well and am confident that my choice is right for me. If it feels right, I change the plan or resting instead of training.


 “I must enjoy what I do,” continued the reigning Olympic and world champion. “I have a lot of fun with the training. I have to constantly challenge myself, be challenged and look for details where I can get better. It is also important for me to have a good life outside skiing. It is important to stop occasionally and feel how I really feel and why I do what I do.”

He was the hero of the 2017-2018 Olympic cross-country season: at age 21, Johannes Klaebo won three gold medals at PyeongChang 2018 to tie with French biathlete Martin Fourcade for the most gold medals won at the Games. The youngest Olympic champion in his sport, he also became, at the end of the season, the youngest winner of the big FIS Crystal Globe. Norway has a new star! 


On skis by the age of 2 


Johannes Høsflot Klaebo told his story to the FIS after winning his first Crystal Globe (in the sprint) at the end of the 2016-2017 season, his first on the World Cup circuit, during which he continued to compete at the junior level. ""I’m a 20-year old guy from Trondheim. I still live with my younger brother, sister and my parents. My granddad gave me my first pair of skis for Christmas when I was two. Apparently, I was skiing in our living room the whole day. My mum and dad love cross-country skiing, and when we were kids we used to ski a lot together. When I was a kid we spent many hours skiing and jumping. But what I loved most was football. I spent virtually all my time on the pitch and I was sure I would become a footballer."" 


A well-documented journey 


But in the end, growing up in a winter sports nation, it was through cross-country skiing that he would develop his sporting prowess. He participated in his first Junior World Championships in 2015 in Almaty (Kazakhstan), where he won two bronze medals, in the classic sprint and relay. In February 2016, in Râșnov (Romania) he competed in four events and won three gold medals: the freestyle sprint, the 10km classic and the relay. In the same season, he joined the World Cup circuit for the first time. In his second race at this level, in Ruka (Finland) in November 2016, he was on the podium: third in the sprint. He took his first World Cup title, again in the sprint, in Otepää (Estonia) on 18 February 2017, and finished the pre-Olympic season with a bang, winning the “minitour” of Quebec and the Crystal Globe for the sprint. In addition, at the beginning of the year, he started a “vlog” on his YouTube channel, through which he gives his fans – 60,000 subscribers, and some videos with over 200,000 views – a weekly insight into his life as a top-level athlete, by filming and commentating on his journeys across the snow-covered parts of the world. 


An Olympic winter at the top of the world


The young cross-country skier from Trondheim arrived at the PyeongChang Games with a formidable reputation. He was the sensation of the winter season, having already secured 12 wins and 19 podium finishes in 23 races on the World Cup circuit. He impressed audiences and his Norwegian team-mates alike, which included the winner of the overall standings of the last two FIS World Cups, Martin Jonhsrud Sundby. ""What Klaebo’s done during these three days is just incredible. He’s probably the best Norwegian cross-country skier we’ve ever had. This kid is worth the admission fee alone. Only Bjorn Daehlie and Petter Northug are still ahead of him. He’s the best in the world already,"" said Sundby in Ruka at the start of the cross-country winter season from 24 to 26 November 2017, and where Johannes left everyone else behind. He continued his dominant form by winning a total of seven victories before the end of the year, a feat which had never been achieved in just the first two months of the cross-country World Cup. By which point he had a healthy lead in the overall standings. 


The youngest Olympic champion in his sport 


On 11 February 2018, the 15km + 15km skiathlon, the first event to be contested in the Olympic Stadium in Alpensia, ended in an all Norwegian podium. Simen Hegstad Krueger took gold, with the silver going to Martin Johnsrud Sundby and the bronze to Hans Christer Hollund. Not in the mix, Johannes took 10th place. But 48 hours later in the sprint classic, he launched a strong attack on the final hill of the circuit to win in superb style and become, at the age of 21 and 114 days, the youngest cross-country Olympic champion of all time. ""I think there was an enormous amount of pressure from outside in these last two weeks, and to show that I am capable of winning here, it's just incredible,"" he explained. ""Of course, it is tough. It has been a few days since I had a good night's sleep. But now, I can relax and concentrate on the rest of the programme. But I am going to celebrate this now too."" And on the subject of his record as the youngest cross-country Olympic champion, he added: ""Yes, I heard that. It is certainly very cool. I just need to concentrate on what I have to do. And as the pressure can get to you, it is even better to win convincingly. It is just the first event, and I am impatient for the next ones!""


Team gold 


On 18 February, Johannes secured gold for Norway in the 4 x 10km relay. He raced the anchor leg of the relay, in which he left his team's final rival, the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR), Denis Spitsov, firmly behind with an unanswerable acceleration on the penultimate hill. Didrik Tønseth, Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Simen Hegstad Krueger, who were waiting in the finish area to celebrate with their team-mate, were completely stunned. ""Many of our skiers could have competed in this relay. We are just grateful to be here, and to be able to go after the gold. On the final lap, I was feeling strong. Also in my first lap, and my skis were well prepared so I knew that I could attack at that moment, on the penultimate hill. I was feeling strong and managed to increase the gap; it was an incredible feeling,"" explained the hero of the day. Three days later, there was another gold to contest in the team sprint free. Johannes and Sundby left no room for suspense. It was the younger of the two who finished the job with a significant lead over the OAR and French duos. There were only two triple Olympic champions at PyeongChang 2018: the French biathlete Martin Fourcade and Johannes Høsflot Klaebo! 


""This guy inspires me,"" said Sundby. ""He only came in last season and in this season, maybe showing us how modern cross-country skiing should be. He is a talent that everybody can see for themselves, but he is only 21 years old. I may have one or two bits of advice to give him over the next few years, but for sure he has taken cross-country skiing to another level.""


The icing on the cake 


After his achievements in Korea, the Norwegian phenomenon still had a task to finish: win the FIS Crystal Globe. Although he reported on his vlog that he was having difficulty motivating himself, and was particularly tired, he mustered up what mental and physical strength he had left for the final events in Lahti (Finland), Drammen and Olso (Norway) and finally Falun (Sweden), and with his 14th victory of the winter – the sprint in Falun on 16 March – became the youngest ever winner of the overall standings in the history of the cross-country skiing World Cup. ""This season has been completely crazy. And now, I am impatient for the next one to begin,"" he said. This roaring start to the young Norwegian's career is just the prologue to what promises to be a tremendous sporting journey at the very highest level.

Born October 10, 1984 American Elana Meyers Taylor is the definition of bobsleigh royalty.


At Beijing 2022 the California native confirmed her status as such when, age 37, she won a silver in the women's inaugural monobob competition and bronze in the two-person bobsleigh with brakewoman Sylvia Hoffman to become the most decorated Black athlete in the history of the Winter Olympics.


With her two medals from the Chinese capital the American now sits on a total of five Olympic medals - three silver and two bronze - meaning that in five races, at four Olympics, she has never finished off the podium.


Her success in the Chinese capital comes off the back of a career where Meyers Taylor has achieved almost everything her sport has to offer.


It all started at the 2009 World Championships, where she piloted to silver in the two-woman event alongside Shauna Rohbock in Lake Placid, USA.


That performance helped Meyers Taylor get selected for the USA at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, where she finished with a bronze medal. Another world silver followed at the 2013 world champs in St. Moritz, Switzerland, alongside brakewoman Katie Eberling.


The 2014 season turned out to be a significant turning point for Meyers Taylor on several levels.


Firstly, the American partnered up with Lauryn Williams to win Olympic silver at Sochi 2014. It was also the season where the IBSF announced it would allow mix-gender crews to compete in 4-person bobsleigh, and on 8 November, she piloted a four-person crew to third place in the US trials, securing a place to compete for the US national team with only having four day of experience in a four-person sled.


On November 15, 2014, Meyers Taylor partnered her husband and fellow bobsleigh athlete Nic Taylor to become the first women (alongside Kaillie Humphries) to compete with and against men in an international four-person bobsleigh competition, in the season-opening North American Cup race in Park City, Utah.


Another huge first saw Meyers Taylor secure her - and the United States' - first two-woman world title in 2015 at Winterberg, Germany, alongside pusher Cherrelle Garrett. It was a feat she would go on to repeat at the 2017 Worlds, where she claimed gold again this time, with Kehri Jones.


Meyers Taylor then went on to win her third Olympic medal at the PyeongChang 2018 Games, this time with Lauren Gibbs as brakewoman. Little did she know then, that with the inclusion of the monobob event - something she and Humphries had passionately been advocating for for years - that by the next Olympic cycle would become a sporting legend.


Taylor's talents also extend beyond the snow. She attended George Washington University on a softball scholarship, and in 2014 represented the USA women's rugby sevens team at the China Women's Sevens. She has also served as president of the Women's Sports Foundation, empowering future female athletes.

Kaillie Humphries is one of bobsleigh's greats, having won the two-woman race at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014, and bronze at PyeongChang 2018 while competing for Canada. In 2019, the Calgary-born driver switched allegiance to the USA, and won two-woman gold at the 2020 World Championships. Two more World Championships golds were added in 2021, including the monobob which will made its Olympic debut at Beijing 2022.


Disappointment in Turin


Kaillie Humphries began her international career as a brakewoman, earning a place in the Canadian team for Turin 2006. After parading with the rest of the delegation at the Opening Ceremony, her dreams of competing were dashed when she was informed by team management that she would not be taking part. “I just started crying and went to my room. I thought, ‘Do I stay here and gain experience or do I go home?’” she said. “I decided to stay and support my team by cheering them on. I thought I couldn’t let that be my Olympic experience, so that was when I made the decision to become a bobsleigh pilot.”


 Victory in Vancouver


Humphries began training with brakewoman Heather Moyse, and it was not long before impressive results started to come their way in the World Cup. After winning their first race at Altenberg in December 2009, they headed to Vancouver 2010 ranked second in the world. On board Canada 1, Humphries and Moyse swept the rest of the field aside, beating the Whistler Sliding Centre start and track records in each of the first three runs to claim a convincing gold. In becoming the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic bobsleigh title and the first Canadian to win gold in a two-man event, Humphries also secured what was only her country’s second ever bobsleigh crown, 46 years on from Peter Kirby, Doug Anakin and John and Vic Emery’s win in the four-man event at Innsbruck.


Different partners, same result


The Calgary pilot went on to become the world No. 1, a status she would retain with various partners. After Moyse moved on, Humphries won the 2011-12 World Cup title with Emily Baadsvik, and then teamed up with Jennifer Ciochetti to land the world title in Lake Placid in February 2012. The following season, this time partnered by Chelsea Valois, she scored an incredible six consecutive World Cup wins, a feat she capped by retaining her world title in St Moritz in January 2013.


A landmark achievement


In the meantime, Humphries also represented her country at the 2010 Women’s Rugby World Cup and competed in international track cycling events before undergoing hip surgery in 2012. She was reunited with Moyse at the start of the 2013-14 season, with the pair gradually finding their form before delivering a stunning performance at Sochi 2014. Trailing the US pair Elana Meyers and Lauryn Williams going into the fourth and final run, the Canadians produced a scintillating descent to pip their rivals by 0.10 seconds and become the first duo ever to retain the Olympic two-woman title.


“It’s hard to express how I feel,” Humphries later said. “There have been a lot of sacrifices, not only on my part but by my friends and my family. And Heather has come back on board after having had an operation. This is something that we’ve done together and it’s a fantastic feeling. After the third run I knew that if we did our job we’d make it to the top.”


More World Cup wins


By the end of the 2013/14 season, Humphries had won her second two-woman World Cup title. After finishing second to Elana Meyers-Taylor the following year, she won the World Cup for a third time in 2015/16 before taking second place again, this time behind the USA’s Jamie Greubel Poser.


A vociferous advocate of the four-woman bobsleigh, Humphries drove a mixed bob and then formed part of an all-woman bob that competed against all-male crews in the IBSF World Cup in 2016, part of her campaign to have the four-woman included on the Olympic programme.


Prior to appearing at her fourth Winter Games, Humphries won the two-woman World Cup crown for a fourth time, triumphing in four of the eight events, with Melissa Lotholz behind her in the first part of the season and Phylicia George taking over brakewoman duties in the second. And it was with George that Humphries would go for Olympic gold again at PyeongChang 2018.


A bronze in Pyeongchang 


The Canadian duo lay a lowly fifth after the first two runs at the Alpensia Sliding Centre, with Germany’s Mariana Jamanka and Lisa Buckwitz fighting it out with Meyers-Taylor and Lauren Gibbs of the USA for first place.


By the end of the third run Humphries and George had climbed up to third, where they would remain after the fourth, 0.44 seconds behind Jamanka and Buckwitz, who beat Meyers-Taylor and Gibbs to the gold by 0.07 seconds.


“This is probably my most emotional medal because of all the hard work we’ve put in, the investment we’ve put in and the importance of it,” said Humphries after becoming a three-time Olympic medallist. “I’m so happy right now. It’s a great honour to take part in the Olympic Games and represent Canada.”


Switching to the USA 


In 2019, Bobsleigh Canada ranted Humphries' request to be released from their programme, in order to join the United States. The switch seemed to give her a boost, resulting in the two-woman 2020 World Championships title. The good form continued into the 20201 world champs, where she partnered former hurdler Lolo Jones to gold in the two-woman, before taking gold in the monobob - which made its debut at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

Francesco Friedrich cemented his reputation as one of the greatest bobsleigh pilots in history at Beijing 2022 by retaining his Olympic titles in the two-man and four-man bob.


Born in Pirna in Saxony, Friedrich - commonly known as ""Franz"" - switched from athletics to bobsleigh at 16. His older brother, David, was his pusher until his career was hampered by injury.


He won two-man gold and four-man silver at the 2011 World Junior Championships in Park City, Utah. Two weeks later, Friedrich was 11th in the two-man bob at his first senior World Championships in Koenigsee and claimed gold in the mixed team event featuring bobsleigh and skeleton athletes.


The young driver joined the IBSF World Cup circuit the following year and finished fourth at the World Championships before securing his first World Cup win at Altenburg in January 2013.


Later that month, while still only 22, he became the youngest world champion driver with victory in the two-man bob with brakeman Jannis Baecker.


Friedrich's first Olympic season proved to be a disappointment as he failed to add to his two World Cup wins and only finished sixth in the two-man and eighth in the four-man at Sochi 2014.


But that setback only served to spur him on to a reign of dominance at World Cups and World Championships.


After Friedrich's second world two-man bob title in 2015, coach Gerd Leopold said, ""Franz is a talent that you only see once every hundred years. He has everything needed to make bobsleigh history over the years to come; he is capable of putting his failures behind him and drawing astute conclusions from them.""


His charge has certainly lived up to that lofty billing, winning seven consecutive two-man world titles and four straight four-man crowns.


Friedrich also achieved success on the biggest stage of all, although victory in the two-man bob appeared unlikely after the first day with he and Thorsten Margis lying in fifth place overnight.


But a track record in heat three and the quickest time on the fourth and final run saw the pair tie for gold with Canada's Justin Kripps and Alex Kopacz.


It was not the first time Friedrich had shared the spoils. A year earlier, he and fellow German Johannes Lochner clocked identical aggregate times in the World Championship four-man bob event.


He said afterwards, ""It's really crazy! There were 0.06 seconds between us and we thought that the Canadians were going to win, or that it could end in a draw. I was hoping that it would end like that, and that it would be like at the World Championships in the fours last year, and that's what happened. Fantastic! We have worked so many years for this!""


That was just the start. In the four-man, Friedich - with Margis, Candy Bauer and Martin Grothkopp - dominated from the start with the fastest time in each of the first three heats making the fourth run a victory cruise. They finished over half a second clear of the chasing pack to make Friedrich the sixth bobsleigh pilot to complete the two-man and four-man double at the same Games.


That Olympic triumph was backed up by near-total supremacy with Friedrich taking his World Cup wins tally to 44 in two-man and 22 in four-man.


He was the hot favourite for both events at Beijing 2022 and promptly delivered.


Together with Margis again in the two-man, Friedrich set track records in heats one and three on his way to victory by over Lochner by almost half a second.


Lochner set a track record in the opening heat of the four-man, but Friedrich - with Margis, Bauer and Alexander Schueller - was quickest on each of the next three runs to complete an unprecedented double-double of bobsleigh titles.


Only Andre Lange had previously retained the two-man (2006, 2010) and four-man titles (2002, 2006) but Friedrich is the first to do the double twice at the same Games.


He said, ""We are so happy, and the boys did an amazing job. All those in the background helped us. Without that, it would be not possible to do this.


""I'm lucky that what I'm doing is my job, it's what I love. There's only so much time you have in life that you can perform sport at this level. We take every day, every hour and every second to work flat out to do the best we can.""


Friedrich's attention to detail is legendary. The team is also involved in a bakery in his home region of Saxony with some of the proceeds used to fund the team.


The bobsleigh legend will be 33 at Milano Cortina 2026 where he could add more gold to his already brilliant legacy.

Nicknamed “Six Feet of Sunshine”, Kerri Walsh-Jennings formed part of the greatest pairing beach volleyball has ever seen, teaming up with Misty May-Treanor to win three Olympic gold medals and three world titles and go unbeaten for a remarkable 112 games. On returning to the Olympic stage at Rio 2016 with a new partner, April Ross, she won bronze at the age of 37. 





An Olympic debut, indoors 


Born in California, Kerri Walsh was an exceptionally talented college volleyball player, helping Stanford University win the 1996 and 1997 NCAA titles and being named MVP in both finals, against Hawai’i and Penn State respectively. She was also only the second college volleyball player in history to feature in the All-American first-team four years in a row.


Walsh was only 22 when she made her Olympic debut, at Sydney 2000, with the USA volleyball team. Beaten in five sets by Russia in the semi-finals, the Americans finished out of the medals after losing to Brazil in the match for third place. Though Walsh had already begun suffering the shoulder problems that would dog her throughout her career, her ailment did lead her to improve her tactical understanding and reading of the game and enhance her sense of positioning. 





The greatest pairing of all time 


Also competing for the USA at Sydney 2000 was Misty May-Treanor, who partnered Holly McPeak in beach volleyball, with the pair ending the competition in fifth place. After the Games, May-Treanor invited Walsh to join her, setting the wheels in motion for what would become the most successful tandem in the history of women’s beach volleyball. 


May and Walsh began their long reign on the domestic and global scenes in 2001, going on to dominate proceedings on the U.S. professional tour and at the Olympics and FIVB World Championships. Unbeaten in 90 matches when they arrived at Athens 2004, the USA duo swept all before them at the Faliro Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre, winning every match in straight sets and crowning their majestic run by defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar 21-17, 21-11 in the final. 


World champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, May and Walsh were on a 101-match and 18-tournament winning streak when they began their Olympic title defence at Beijing 2008. After cruising through to the final, they beat China’s No1-ranked Tian Jia and Wang Jie in two sets to retain the gold. They eventually took that unbeaten run to 112 matches.


Threepeat at London 2012 


Walsh, who married fellow beach volleyball player Casey Jennings in 2005 and had two children in the years after Beijing, was back on the sand with May-Treanor in 2011, with the pair setting their sights on a third straight gold at London 2012. 


It duly came their way on the court on Horse Guards Parade, where the two Californians saw off April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in two sets in the final. May-Treanor promptly announced her retirement, having played her part in 21 consecutive wins at the Olympics since 2004, a run in which the fabled American pair lost just one set, against Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London. 


Five Games, four medals


Walsh-Jennings invited Ross to be her new playing partner, before giving birth to a third child in 2013. On returning to competitive action, she and Ross nailed down a place at Rio 2016, where she would go in search of a fourth Olympic title at her fifth Games, at the age of 38. 


The American pair made it to the semi-finals, where they went down 22-20, 21-18 to Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas de Freitas, the only defeat Walsh-Jennings ever suffered in her entire Olympic beach volleyball career. Atoning for that reverse, she and Ross then secured bronze with a three-set win over Brazil’s world-No1 pair Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes.


                                    “As an athlete, I swear this is the hardest match I’ve ever played in my life,” Walsh-Jennings said afterwards. “It was all perseverance.” The effort was worth it. In winning her fourth Olympic medal, the American became the most decorated beach volleyball player in the history of the Games.

In an Olympic career that spanned five editions of the Games, beginning with a silver in the quadruple sculls at Sydney 2000 and ending with another in the double sculls at Rio 2016, British rower Dame Katherine Grainger collected a medal at each of her appearances, including double sculls gold with Anna Watkins at London 2012. That makes her Great Britain’s most decorated female Olympian.


Silver in Sydney


Born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Katherine Grainger took up rowing at the age of 18, and won her first major medal in the eight at the 1997 World Championships in Aiguebelette (FRA), where she helped Great Britain collect bronze. She made her Olympic debut at Sydney 2000, where she teamed up with Guin and Miriam Batten, and Gillian Lindsay to win silver in the quadruple sculls behind Germany. It was the first medal of her storied association with the Games.


Yet more silver


Grainger then joined forces with Catherine Bishop in the coxless pair, with the duo winning the world title in Milan in 2003 and going on to collect silver behind Romania’s invincible Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu at Athens 2004.


That second Olympic silver was followed by a third four years later in Beijing, where Grainger, Annabel Vernon, Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton were narrowly beaten by the Chinese quartet in the quadruple sculls, an event in which the Scottish rower had helped Great Britain win three consecutive world titles between 2005 and 2007. 


A winning combination


In 2010, Grainger linked up with Cambridge University rower Anna Watkins in the double sculls, the pair proving such an effective partnership that they went 23 races unbeaten, winning back-to-back world titles in 2010 and 2011 to take the Scot’s haul of world golds to six. With their powerful, instinctive sprint finish, boundless confidence and graceful and perfectly synchronised stroke, Grainger and Watkins were a perfect match on the water.


Wait for gold ends


Grainger was 36 by the time she set off in search of Olympic medal number four on home water at London 2012, with Watkins again in the boat with her. Lining up in the double sculls final in blustery conditions at Eton Dorney, the British pair took an early lead from Australia’s Brooke Pratley and Kim Crow and stretched it to half a length by the 500m mark.


Grainger and Watkins were still forcing the pace at the halfway stage and maintained it to record a famous and much-celebrated victory by a length. The long-awaited gold cemented the Scot’s status as one of the most gifted rowers of all time and erased memories of the narrow defeat to the Chinese four years earlier, which had led her to contemplate retirement.


“Worth the wait,” said Grainger, after receiving a congratulatory hug from fellow British rowing legend Sir Steve Redgrave. “Steve promised me there’d be tears of joy this time, which there are. I feel this medal of all of them is the people’s medal. I feel so many people have been behind me and supported me and wanted this for me as much as I have.


“It’s the fulfilment of a lot of blood, sweat and tears but it doesn’t all sink in. Any Olympic medal is a phenomenal achievement but having had three in the past I wanted a gold one to complete the collection.”


Time for a break


Taking a two-year sabbatical from rowing, Grainger completed a PhD in criminal psychology at King’s College, London, did a bit of TV commentary work and wrote an autobiography entitled Dreams Do Come True. In late 2014, however, having been made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the previous year, she decided to return to the British rowing team. And despite turning 40, Grainger, who was also named chancellor of Oxford Brookes University in March 2015, managed to qualify for her fifth straight Games, in the double sculls. Her new partner, Victoria Thornley, was 12 years her junior.


A silver swansong in Rio


After placing second in both their heat and their semi-final, Grainger and Thornley set off in search of gold in the final, where they would fight it out with Poland’s Magdalena Fularczyk-Kozłowska and Natalia Mataj.


In the lead at 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m, where they held an advantage of 1.25 seconds, the British duo were reeled in by their Polish rivals in the closing 200m and finished nearly a second off the pace in second, well ahead of Lithuania’s Donata Vištartaitė and Milda Valčiukaitė in third.


“Mum and Dad, I promise: I will never put you through that again,” announced Grainger immediately after making it five medals in five Games to set a new British record. “They’ve been through it five times with me. They weren’t sure if coming back was the right thing for me and they’ve been so supportive since I did. We all know it was the right decision now. But at the same time, I think maybe that’s enough.” 


                                    The veteran added: “I have had my happiest and hardest days on the water. The closest friendships I’ve made have been through this sport and it’s hard to imagine it not being my life in some way. I’ll never leave it and it’ll never leave me but I look forward to not setting my alarm for dawn and waking up as late as I want.”

In retaining their Olympic coxless pairs title at Rio 2016, New Zealand rowers Hamish Bond and Eric Murray extended their remarkable unbeaten run in international regattas to 69 races over eight seasons, cementing their status as one of the greatest double acts the sport has ever seen.


A blow in Beijing The Dunedin-born Bond and the Hastings-born Murray, who is the senior of the two by nearly four years, first came together in the coxless four crew that won the world title in Munich in 2007. That NZ quartet, which also featured James Dallinger and Carl Meyer, brought an abrupt end to Great Britain’s domination of the event by winning seven of the eight international races on the programme that year. The New Zealand four went to Beijing 2008 as strong favourites for gold. Surprisingly, however, they missed out on a place in the final and eventually had to settle for first place in the B final, though Bond did have the consolation of becoming New Zealand’s 1,000th ever Olympian in China. The start of a wonderful storyIn response to that major disappointment, Bond and Murray decided to change to a new boat. “It had been in the back of my mind since Beijing,” said the younger member of the pair, “We’d trained in pairs while we were preparing for the four and we had done some fast times. I knew that the combination had potential. Eric was taking time away from the sport and looking at his options and I approached him and he decided it would be worth a crack. Thankfully the selectors, in their infinite wisdom, agreed.” The rest is history. The duo began their supremacy by winning the coxless pair world title in Poznan (POL) in 2009, a year that also saw them win the New Zealand Team of the Year award. They retained that world title on home water in Karapiro the following year, and again in 2011 in Bled (SLO), and won every World Cup event they contested in the lead-up to London 2012.Breaking records in LondonBond and Murray laid down the best possible marker on their first outing at the London Games, setting a new world record of 6:08.50 on the water at Eton Dorney to win the first heat by nearly ten seconds from French pair Germain Chardin and Dorian Mortelette. Two days later the Kiwis cruised to victory in their semi-final, crossing the line with a comfortable margin over Italy’s Niccolo Mornati and Lorenzo CarbonciniThe NZ duo lined up in Lane 6 in the final and made a fast start in their bid for gold, though they trailed their French rivals by three hundredths of a second at the 500m mark. From that point on, however, the red-hot favourites took control, hitting 38 strokes a minute to pull out a 1.5-second lead over Chardin and Mortelette after 1,000m.Gliding across the water at an average speed of 19.1 km/h, the uncatchable Kiwis passed the 1,500m marker more than five seconds clear of Great Britain’s George Nash and William Satch, who were battling it out with the French for silver, a duel Chardin and Mortelette eventually won by a nose. Ahead of them, Bond and Murray crossed the line in 6:16.65 to seal gold in emphatic fashion.“It was great when I first got back (to New Zealand) and one of the coolest things I got to do was the All Blacks (the national rugby team) hosting all of the Olympic medallists in Dunedin,” said Bond, recalling the days that followed their Olympic triumph. “They introduced us at half-time to a full crowd of 30,000. It was a surreal feeling to have 30,000 people applaud and give a standing ovation. I’d almost put it on a par with the medal ceremony in London.”Staying on topNamed members of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2013, Bond and Murray continued to sweep aside all before them in the coxless pair, cruising to a fourth world title in Chungju (KOR) that September, and then a fifth the following August in Amsterdam (NED), where they also won the non-Olympic coxed pair event with Caleb Shepherd. An inevitable sixth world crown then came their way in Aiguebelette (FRA) in September 2015.“We don’t go out to defend anything,” said Murray, explaining their philosophy. “That’s the way we’ve always worked, which has been successful for us. You’ve got to go out there and win every single race you’re competing in. For the other crews, they’ve never beaten us, so they’ve probably got doubts: ‘Are we going to beat them? Probably not, because nobody ever has’. And that’s what’s really been driving us for the last four years: it’s been going out to try and win another gold medal at the Olympics.”Ruthless in Rio After dominating the heats and the semi-final at Rio 2016, Bond and Murray made a typically low-key start to their title defence in the final, lying third at the 500m mark behind Lawrence Brittain and Shaun Keeling of South Africa, and Giovanni Abagnale and Marco Di Costanzo of Italy. Gradually stepping up the pace, the NZ pair edged into the lead by the halfway point, 1.30 seconds ahead of the Italians. It was then that the defending champions hit the accelerator, pulling away from the rest of the field to open up a five-second advantage with 500m to go, with Great Britain’s Alan Sinclair and Stewart Innes joining the Italians and the South Africans in the battle for silver and bronze. Maintaining their stroke and composure all the way to the line, Bond and Murray claimed a second consecutive gold in the event in a time of 6:59.71, 2.8 seconds clear of the fast-finishing Brittain and Keeling, with Abagnale and Di Costanzo coming in third, 4.81 seconds behind the winners. Their second Olympic win stretched the six-time world champions’ undefeated run to 69 international races spread over eight glorious seasons, a staggering sequence that has made them one of the greatest partnerships the sport of rowing has ever seen. Only too happy to live up to the huge expectations that weighed on them going into Rio 2016, Bond and Murray were elated to have extended their remarkable winning streak in such brilliant fashion.“There’s a lot of relief in there. The conditions were pretty tough,” said Murray. “If we have a good race and we don’t win, we just accept it, but we don’t want to let the New Zealand rowing team down,” added Bond. “We always have to apply ourselves, but we did the hardest work in the four years leading up to this race. That’s what staying unbeaten is all about: All we can do is live up to expectations, not exceed them.” What next?Bond and Murray decided to take a well-earned break in 2017, while leaving the door open to a return to the New Zealand team for Tokyo 2020. “We’ve done the lot in coxless,” said Murray in late 2016. “After London 2012 we won all the races that mattered, and we did it again in Rio. For Tokyo, we could go and do it all over again.“We’re always up for a challenge. The only unfinished business for New Zealand rowing is the eight. We just have to ask ourselves if we feel we can help them to do it or if they’d be better off without us.” Showing his ability to excel off the water as well as on it, Bond took third place in the national cycling time-trial championship in January 2017, an indication – if it were needed – of the remarkable athleticism that has helped Murray and him to reach the pinnacle of rowing and remain there.

After hitting a career high in winning Olympic gold in the coxless pairs on home water at London 2012, British rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning went on to dominate their event and retain their title at Rio 2016. Both retired after Rio, but after having three children and being inspired to get back in shape during the pandemic lockdown in 2020, Glover returned to elite sport and competed at Tokyo 2020 (in 2021) with new partner Polly Swann, finishing fourth in the final and just missing out on a medal.


An unlikely duo


It was only in 2008, four years before the London Games, that Heather Stanning and Helen Glover had their first taste of international rowing. Born on 26 January 1985 in Yeovil, Somerset, Stanning had originally turned her back on sport to focus on her military career, serving in Afghanistan as an officer in the Royal Artillery. Meanwhile, her future rowing partner Glover, who was born on 17 June 1986 in Truro, Cornwall, was a PE teacher trying to break into Great Britain’s Olympic hockey team.   


One of 4,000 people responding to a national campaign to unearth sporting talent, which was headed up by five-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Steve Redgrave, Glover earned selection for the rowing programme. For her part, Stanning was moved to pursue her ambitions in the sport after watching the rowing competitions at Beijing 2008, deciding that she still had goals to fulfil and to push herself to the limit to achieve them.  


Hitting their stroke


The British duo’s rise to the top began when the coach Paul Stannard put them together in the coxless pairs in 2010. Though they came away empty-handed from their first World Cup regattas that year, the gap separating them from more established pairs ahead was relatively small. Despite Glover’s lack of experience and the fact their partnership was still in its infancy, they improved so rapidly that they won silver at their maiden World Championships that November, on Lake Karapiro in New Zealand.   


Home sweet home


Devoting their energies entirely to their sport ever since, Glover and Stanning set about preparing for the Olympic Games London 2012. In the season leading up to that date with destiny, they won every round of the FISA World Rowing Cup they contested and were favourites by the time they lined up for the start of the coxless pair Olympic final at Eton Dorney on 1 August 2012, having set a Games record of 6:57.29 in winning their heat.   


With 32,000 expectant spectators in the stands, the pressure on them to win Great Britain’s first gold of its home Games and the first ever for British women’s rowing was intense.  


Living the dream


Recalling her thoughts as the home crowd voiced their encouragement at the start line, Glover said: “I remember the feeling was quite ready, just quite calm.” Adding her recollections, partner Stanning said: “I think it’s always quite nice in this part of the race because you’ve gone out at the start, you’ve got an idea of what’s going on and then you can relax into the race a little bit.”  


Jumping into an early lead, the British boat quickly pulled away from the rest of the field and stayed well ahead all the way to the finish line. Settling to 36 strokes a minute, Glover and Stanning passed the 1,000m marker in a time of 3:39.5, some 3.5 seconds clear of New Zealand’s Juliette Haigh and Rebecca Scown, with Australia’s Kate Hornsey and Sarah Tait 6.2 adrift of the leaders.  


As the finish line approached so the noise from the crowd increased, as Stanning recalled: “Normally you only hear people in the last 250 metres. So having that extra 500 metres of people, it kind of swallows up that bit of the race quite quickly.”   


The lead over the Kiwis had grown to five seconds with 500m remaining, with Glover and Stanning eventually easing over the line to spark scenes of great celebration in the stands. Behind them, a little over two seconds adrift, the Australian pair took silver, having overhauled the New Zealanders in the sprint for the line.  


“I just remember feeling utter relief because we’d won every race that season coming up to it,” said Glover. “I was so tired but so excited and I couldn’t even lift myself to get up off my seat or get back on my seat,” added Stanning. The pair looked up to see their coaches waving excitedly at them from the bank. “That was one of the nicest moments actually just seeing them,” recalled Glover. “No matter what happens for the rest of my life, I’ve done something I can be proud of forever. No one can ever take that away from me.”  


Just the start


London 2012 was just the start for the pair, however. When Stanning then took a break from rowing to return to the armed forces, Glover teamed up with Polly Swan to win her maiden world title in Chungju (KOR) in 2013. A year later, the Olympic champions were reunited and showed they had lost none of their magic by setting a new coxless pair world record of 6:50.61 in becoming world champions in Amsterdam. Another world title followed in Aiguebelette (FRA) in 2015, with the British duo also winning three consecutive European crowns between 2014 and 2016.   


Comfortable winners of the British Olympic trial in March 2016, the all-conquering Glover and Stanning headed to Rio as the reigning Olympic, world and European champions and very firm favourites to retain their title in Brazil.  


A procession in Rio


The British pair eased through their heats in Rio. The Olympic and world record holders over 2,000m, they defended their title in style, leading the final from start to finish and holding a four-second lead over Denmark’s Hedvig Rasmussen and Anne Andersen at the halfway stage. The Danes were caught by New Zealand’s Genevieve Behrens and Rebecca Scown in the closing stages, with the Kiwis taking silver, 1.24 seconds behind the invincible Glover and Stanning.  


""I just want to find our coach and family and friends because it’s all for them. I want to say thank you,” said Glover afterwards, while a delighted Stanning was moved to compare their second triumph to the first: “I know it was a home Games and there’s nothing more special, but this was defending a title. This is not being good once, it’s being good every day, every race. It just feels so good with all the pressure we put on ourselves. It’s pretty immense.”


Retirement and return


Glover and Stanning retired after Rio, with Glover giving birth to children in 2018 and 2020. After giving birth to twins in January 2020, the pandemic hit, and during lockdown she was inspired to resume training to try to return to elite sport.


The return alongside new partner Polly Swann was a successful one as the coxless pair crew won European gold in 2021, before finishing fourth in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic final.

David Florence followed his father, a former Scottish champion, into canoeing and took part in his first competition at the age of 15. He grew up on the same Edinburgh street as Chris Hoy and attended Stewart’s Melville College before studying Mathematical Physics at the University of Nottingham. Florence made his World Championship début in 2005 and was runner-up in the season long World Cup series two years later. A two-second penalty that Florence incurred on the first run of the Olympic final was the difference between first and second place and meant that he would have to settle for silver and not gold. He was World Cup champion in 2009 but did not win a World Championship medal until 2011, after adding Canadian doubles to his usual singles campaign, he was a member of the British team that won a bronze medal in the C-2 team event, and with Richard Hounslow, he won a silver medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in the C-2 event, and in competing in Rio Florence became the first British slalom canoeist to appear in three successive Games. At the 2013 World Championships in Praha, he became the first man for 60 years to win C-1 and C-2 titles in the same year and also the first Briton to win both titles. He retained his C-1 title on his home course at the Lee Valley White Water Centre in 2015. Florence is an avid bagpipe player and is an all-round sportsman, playing tennis and golf, and he also enjoys skiing. He also learnt Mandarin Chinese before the Beijing Olympics.

David Boudia is the United States' most successful diver of the 21st century, winning four medals from three Olympic Games. When he won 10-metre platform gold at London 2012, Boudia became the first male American Olympic champion in diving since Mark Lenzi won 3m gold 20 years earlier.


Boudia won his first major international medal in 2007, taking Pan Am Games gold and World Championships bronze in synchro diving alongside Thomas Finchum. An Olympic appearance followed in Beijing, before further success at World Championships level with silvers in 2009 and 2011.


But the big breakthrough came in the British capital in 2012, when he came from 18th in the preliminaries – the last diver not to be eliminated – to stun world champion Qiu Bo and home favourite Tom Daley in the 10m platform final. It was the first diving gold medal for the U.S. since Laura Wilkinson's women's 10m gold in 2000.


After two more medals – silver and bronze – in Rio four years later, Boudia took time off from diving. Upon his return to competition, a serious concussion suffered after a training incident led the diver to change tack, switching to the lower 3m springboard. ""Training 10m was a little mundane and pushing the 3m springboard added some extra motivation,"" he said.

At just fourteen years and three months old, Tom Daley was the youngest British Olympian since rowing coxswain Ken Lester, when he competed at the Beijing Olympics. Daley, who began diving at the age of seven, won the British national junior (under-18) platform title in 2004 just a few days after his tenth birthday. In 2007 he became the youngest ever winner of a British senior title when he took the individual platform event and the following years retained his title and added the synchronised event with partner Blake Aldridge. In March 2008 he scored a surprise victory at the European Championships in Eindhoven to become the youngest ever European champion in either swimming or diving. After Beijing he claimed two silver medals at the 2008 World Junior Championships, before winning the senior World Championship in 2009 at the age of 15. Daley won two gold medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, in the 10-metre individual and synchronized event with Max Brick. He competed in his second Olympics in 2012 and won an individual bronze medal. After the London Games, he gained celebrity status and hosted his own TV show entitled Splash! 


Daley won a second successive Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2014, and also a silver, in the synchronized event with James Denny. The following year Daley won the inaugural team event at the World Championship with Rebecca Gallantree and ay Rio in 2016, Daley won a second Olympic bronze medal, with Daniel Goodfellow in the synchronized event. In qualifying for the semi-finals in the individual competition with a new Olympic record, Daley was clear favourite to make the final and collect a third Olympic medal. However, he had a succession of disastrous dives, and was eliminated.

The winner of seven Olympic medals (five of them gold) and 14 World Championship medals (eight of them gold), China’s Wu Minxia is the most decorated female athlete in the history of diving. As well as collecting four consecutive Olympic 3m synchronised springboard titles between Athens 2004 and Rio 2016 with three different partners, she also won the 3m individual springboard gold at London 2012. 


The quest for individual gold


Wu Minxia’s long and hugely successful Olympic career began at Athens 2004. Partnering Guo Jingjing, she won gold in the 3m women’s synchronised springboard event, a title the duo retained at Beijing 2008, where Guo added another individual 3m springboard title to go with the one she had pocketed in the Greek capital four years earlier.Spotted at a very early age but hampered on her rise to the top by a string of injuries, Wu grew accustomed to being in Guo’s shadow. However, she never gave up hope of fulfilling the dream she had pursued since her childhood, when she would watch on TV as China’s divers soared to success on the Olympic stage, resolving to follow the trail they blazed.After taking individual 3m springboard silver behind Guo in Athens and collecting the bronze in Beijing, when Russia’s Yuliya Pakhalina split the Chinese duo, the ambitious Wu was determined to kick on and finally make that dream a reality.


A long-awaited world title


The turning point in her career came in 2011, a year that began with Guo announcing her retirement after amassing six Olympic medals, four of them gold, a record unrivalled at the time. Together Guo and Wu had also won four 3m synchronised springboard world titles (in 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009), and Wu would win another in Shanghai in 2011 with new partner He Zi. As a sign of things to come, Wu also claimed her one and only world 3m individual title that year, finishing ahead of He in a Chinese one-two.


Coronation in London 


There would be identical outcomes at London 2012, where Wu and He eased to synchronised springboard gold, top-scoring with each of their five dives to rack up a total of 346.20 points and win by a distance from USA’s Kelci Bryant and Abigail Johnston, and the Canadian duo of Jennifer Abel and Emilie Heymans. It was Wu’s third consecutive Olympic gold in the event. Held over three days, Wu dominating proceedings in the preliminary round of the individual 3m springboard competition  The 26-year-old was out in front again in the following day’s semi-finals, and then closed out the competition a day later with five precise dives to win what would be her first and last individual Olympic gold. The only competitor to score in excess of 85 marks – for her third and fifth dives – and to exceed 400 points in total, Wu was a comfortable winner ahead of team-mate He and Mexico’s Laura Sanchez. “I think we all have a dream, and I chose diving, with my aim being to make a difference,” she said at the time. “I never gave up on that dream, though I haven’t achieved this on my own. So many people have supported me, from my family and my coach, to a whole lot of other people behind the scenes.” In winning her sixth Olympic medal, Wu joined the great Guo at the pinnacle of women’s diving, while FINA named her Athlete of the Year in the female diving category in both 2011 and 2012. 


A new partner, more success 


Wu then joined forces with Shi Tingmao in the 3m synchro event, with the pair taking the world title in Barcelona (ESP) in 2013 and retaining it in Kazan (RUS) two years later. In the process, Wu became the first diver in history to win seven world golds in the event, with three different partners. “I’m getting older and it takes longer for me to recover now,” she said after her Kazan triumph. “I need to be efficient when I train and try to avoid picking up injuries. The synchronised was my only event here, and it’s always difficult to win the gold.” 


A matchless record


Wu came close to missing out on Rio 2016 after suffering a leg injury two months before the Games. She made the trip but sat out the individual competition, looking on as her current synchro partner Shi won by a distance from her former partner He. One week later, Wu was back in action alongside Shi to win her fourth consecutive synchronised gold from Italy’s Tania Gagnotto and Francesca Dallapé and Australia’s Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith. In climbing to the top of another Olympic podium, Wu joined her compatriot Chen Ruolin – who won a third consecutive 10m synchro title in Rio – on five diving golds, one more than American great Greg Louganis and her “big sister” Guo. Wu holds the distinctions, however, of being the most decorated Olympic diver in history with seven medals and the oldest woman to win Olympic gold in the sport.


Bowing out


On 22 December 2016, Wu announced her retirement from competitive diving at the age of 31. “Reluctantly, it’s time to call it a day,” she said live on Chinese TV. “The story of Chinese diving didn’t start with me and it won’t end with me. I am really sorry, but my physical condition does not allow me to continue training. I’ve always feared this day coming.” Though maybe not the first or the last great Chinese diver to grace the boards, Wu will no doubt remain the most successful for many years to come.

Three-time Olympic women’s doubles champions, Venus and Serena Williams have each won four golds at the Games. The elder of the two was also the first to complete the singles and doubles ‘double’, at Sydney 2000, a feat her sibling repeated 12 years later. In winning a fifth medal – mixed doubles silver – at Rio 2016, Venus became the most decorated tennis player in Olympic history since 1896.


Sister actOne of five siblings, Venus Williams was born in Lynwood, California, 15 months before her sister and future doubles partner, Serena. Their father Richard was determined that his daughters would be tennis champions and took on the role of coaching them himself from a very young age. Venus and Serena were both quick to develop their physical strength (Venus was already producing serves in excess of 160 km/h by the age of 10), winning numerous tournaments across the USA as they progressed through the age categories. Venus turned professional when she was just 14. Three years later, in 1997, she became the first unseeded player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam final, at the US Open, only to be outclassed by Switzerland’s Martina Hingis.First Olympic titlesIt was Serena who kickstarted the Williams sisters’ era of Grand Slam domination, claiming the US Open title in 1999. The following year, Venus won the first of her own Grand Slam titles, triumphing at Wimbledon and then the US Open, defeating fellow American Lindsay Davenport on both occasions. Straight after her victory in New York, she headed for Sydney, where she powered past Russia’s Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-4 to win Olympic gold in the women’s singles final. The following day she teamed up with Serena for the women’s doubles final, with the sisters taking just 49 minutes to dispatch Dutch pair Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans 6-1, 6-1. In the process, Venus became the first woman to win the singles and doubles at the same Games since Helen Wills Moody in 1924. It was the start of the Williams sisters’ longstanding love affair with the Olympic doubles tournament. Speaking after that first win, Venus said: “For me, this is almost bigger than singles. To have a victory like this with Serena, my sister, a member of my family and my best friend, doesn't happen often. It's very rare. Just to be able to play and win together at this level is really huge.” Winning together was something the sisters would go on to do on many occasions in the years that followed. Williams vs Williams In 2001, Venus and Serena became the first sisters to contest a major tournament final when they faced off at the US Open. On that occasion it was the elder sibling who came out on top. In February 2002, Venus was confirmed as world No1, going on to face, and lose against, her sister in a remarkable series of four consecutive Grand Slam finals (from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian). Meanwhile, Venus, whose career was later disrupted by a series of injuries, made Wimbledon her own, winning the event a total of five times. The last of those victories came against Serena in 2008, with the two then joining forces on Centre Court to land a record 14th Grand Slam doubles title.Olympic treble An injury to Serena in August 2004 forced the sisters to withdraw from the women’s doubles in Athens, though they were on top again in 2008 and 2012. In Beijing, they overcame Spain’s Anabel Medina and Virginia Ruano 6-2, 6-0, and on the Wimbledon grass four years later they swept aside Czech duo Andrea Hlavacova and Lucie Hradeck 6-4, 6-4, with Venus securing the gold with a sumptuous backhand volley. “Crazy,” said Serena, who had won the singles final the previous day. “I'm always copying her. I forgot that she did it in Sydney and I do it here. We're the same doubles team, we just split this to singles, so it's cool.”Silver lining in Rio Venus remained a fixture on the WTA Tour in the years that followed. Though major singles titles were no longer coming her way, she did win a sixth Wimbledon women’s doubles title with her sister in 2016, taking to 14 their unbeaten run in Grand Slam finals since 1999. Their proud record of winning every Olympic women’s doubles competition they entered ended at Rio 2016, where they lost 6-3, 6-4 in the first round to Czech pair Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova. Venus tumbled out of the singles at the same stage, beaten in three sets by Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens. She gave herself a chance of becoming the first tennis player – male or female – of all time to win five Olympic golds by reaching the mixed doubles final with Rajeev Ram. It was not to be, however, as their compatriots Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock edged them out 10-7 in the final set. That silver was nevertheless an historic one: it made Venus the most decorated of Olympic tennis player of them all.

Steve Holcomb competed in three Olympic Winter Games, winning a four-man gold at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, piloting a sled he called the “Night Train” to victory, and bronze medals in both bobsleigh events at Sochi in 2014. He became a pilot after serving as a brakeman early in his career, and switched after failing to make the 2002 US Winter Olympic team. Early in his career Holcomb served in the Utah Army National Guard (1999-2006). He won the Overall World Cup title six times, and won 60 medals on the World Cup circuit. Holcomb won five World Championships, winning the two-man in 2012, four-man in 2009 and 2012, and the mixed team in 2012-13.


During the middle of his career, Holcomb developed eye problems with a disorder called keratoconus, and his virtual blindness led to depression. He underwent experimental eye surgery to correct the condition, which was successful. He detailed his struggles in a book published in 2012, But Now I See: My Journey From Blindness to Olympic Gold which also told how in 2007 he attempted suicide at the depths of his depression.


In April 2017, Holcomb was still competing and was training in Lake Placid, New York at the US Olympic Training Center, looking towards the next World Cup season and the 2018 Winter Olympics. Sadly, although only 37-years-old, he was found dead in his room at the training center. No cause of death was announced.

Kaillie Humphries is one of bobsleigh's greats, having won the two-woman race at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014, and bronze at PyeongChang 2018 while competing for Canada. In 2019, the Calgary-born driver switched allegiance to the USA, and won two-woman gold at the 2020 World Championships. Two more World Championships golds were added in 2021, including the monobob which will made its Olympic debut at Beijing 2022.


Disappointment in Turin


Kaillie Humphries began her international career as a brakewoman, earning a place in the Canadian team for Turin 2006. After parading with the rest of the delegation at the Opening Ceremony, her dreams of competing were dashed when she was informed by team management that she would not be taking part. “I just started crying and went to my room. I thought, ‘Do I stay here and gain experience or do I go home?’” she said. “I decided to stay and support my team by cheering them on. I thought I couldn’t let that be my Olympic experience, so that was when I made the decision to become a bobsleigh pilot.”


 Victory in Vancouver


Humphries began training with brakewoman Heather Moyse, and it was not long before impressive results started to come their way in the World Cup. After winning their first race at Altenberg in December 2009, they headed to Vancouver 2010 ranked second in the world. On board Canada 1, Humphries and Moyse swept the rest of the field aside, beating the Whistler Sliding Centre start and track records in each of the first three runs to claim a convincing gold. In becoming the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic bobsleigh title and the first Canadian to win gold in a two-man event, Humphries also secured what was only her country’s second ever bobsleigh crown, 46 years on from Peter Kirby, Doug Anakin and John and Vic Emery’s win in the four-man event at Innsbruck.


Different partners, same result


The Calgary pilot went on to become the world No. 1, a status she would retain with various partners. After Moyse moved on, Humphries won the 2011-12 World Cup title with Emily Baadsvik, and then teamed up with Jennifer Ciochetti to land the world title in Lake Placid in February 2012. The following season, this time partnered by Chelsea Valois, she scored an incredible six consecutive World Cup wins, a feat she capped by retaining her world title in St Moritz in January 2013.


A landmark achievement


In the meantime, Humphries also represented her country at the 2010 Women’s Rugby World Cup and competed in international track cycling events before undergoing hip surgery in 2012. She was reunited with Moyse at the start of the 2013-14 season, with the pair gradually finding their form before delivering a stunning performance at Sochi 2014. Trailing the US pair Elana Meyers and Lauryn Williams going into the fourth and final run, the Canadians produced a scintillating descent to pip their rivals by 0.10 seconds and become the first duo ever to retain the Olympic two-woman title.


“It’s hard to express how I feel,” Humphries later said. “There have been a lot of sacrifices, not only on my part but by my friends and my family. And Heather has come back on board after having had an operation. This is something that we’ve done together and it’s a fantastic feeling. After the third run I knew that if we did our job we’d make it to the top.”


More World Cup wins


By the end of the 2013/14 season, Humphries had won her second two-woman World Cup title. After finishing second to Elana Meyers-Taylor the following year, she won the World Cup for a third time in 2015/16 before taking second place again, this time behind the USA’s Jamie Greubel Poser.


A vociferous advocate of the four-woman bobsleigh, Humphries drove a mixed bob and then formed part of an all-woman bob that competed against all-male crews in the IBSF World Cup in 2016, part of her campaign to have the four-woman included on the Olympic programme.


Prior to appearing at her fourth Winter Games, Humphries won the two-woman World Cup crown for a fourth time, triumphing in four of the eight events, with Melissa Lotholz behind her in the first part of the season and Phylicia George taking over brakewoman duties in the second. And it was with George that Humphries would go for Olympic gold again at PyeongChang 2018.


A bronze in Pyeongchang 


The Canadian duo lay a lowly fifth after the first two runs at the Alpensia Sliding Centre, with Germany’s Mariana Jamanka and Lisa Buckwitz fighting it out with Meyers-Taylor and Lauren Gibbs of the USA for first place.


By the end of the third run Humphries and George had climbed up to third, where they would remain after the fourth, 0.44 seconds behind Jamanka and Buckwitz, who beat Meyers-Taylor and Gibbs to the gold by 0.07 seconds.


“This is probably my most emotional medal because of all the hard work we’ve put in, the investment we’ve put in and the importance of it,” said Humphries after becoming a three-time Olympic medallist. “I’m so happy right now. It’s a great honour to take part in the Olympic Games and represent Canada.”


Switching to the USA 


In 2019, Bobsleigh Canada ranted Humphries' request to be released from their programme, in order to join the United States. The switch seemed to give her a boost, resulting in the two-woman 2020 World Championships title. The good form continued into the 20201 world champs, where she partnered former hurdler Lolo Jones to gold in the two-woman, before taking gold in the monobob - which made its debut at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

Born October 10, 1984 American Elana Meyers Taylor is the definition of bobsleigh royalty.


At Beijing 2022 the California native confirmed her status as such when, age 37, she won a silver in the women's inaugural monobob competition and bronze in the two-person bobsleigh with brakewoman Sylvia Hoffman to become the most decorated Black athlete in the history of the Winter Olympics.


With her two medals from the Chinese capital the American now sits on a total of five Olympic medals - three silver and two bronze - meaning that in five races, at four Olympics, she has never finished off the podium.


Her success in the Chinese capital comes off the back of a career where Meyers Taylor has achieved almost everything her sport has to offer.


It all started at the 2009 World Championships, where she piloted to silver in the two-woman event alongside Shauna Rohbock in Lake Placid, USA.


That performance helped Meyers Taylor get selected for the USA at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, where she finished with a bronze medal. Another world silver followed at the 2013 world champs in St. Moritz, Switzerland, alongside brakewoman Katie Eberling.


The 2014 season turned out to be a significant turning point for Meyers Taylor on several levels.


Firstly, the American partnered up with Lauryn Williams to win Olympic silver at Sochi 2014. It was also the season where the IBSF announced it would allow mix-gender crews to compete in 4-person bobsleigh, and on 8 November, she piloted a four-person crew to third place in the US trials, securing a place to compete for the US national team with only having four day of experience in a four-person sled.


On November 15, 2014, Meyers Taylor partnered her husband and fellow bobsleigh athlete Nic Taylor to become the first women (alongside Kaillie Humphries) to compete with and against men in an international four-person bobsleigh competition, in the season-opening North American Cup race in Park City, Utah.


Another huge first saw Meyers Taylor secure her - and the United States' - first two-woman world title in 2015 at Winterberg, Germany, alongside pusher Cherrelle Garrett. It was a feat she would go on to repeat at the 2017 Worlds, where she claimed gold again this time, with Kehri Jones.


Meyers Taylor then went on to win her third Olympic medal at the PyeongChang 2018 Games, this time with Lauren Gibbs as brakewoman. Little did she know then, that with the inclusion of the monobob event - something she and Humphries had passionately been advocating for for years - that by the next Olympic cycle would become a sporting legend.


Taylor's talents also extend beyond the snow. She attended George Washington University on a softball scholarship, and in 2014 represented the USA women's rugby sevens team at the China Women's Sevens. She has also served as president of the Women's Sports Foundation, empowering future female athletes.

A gold medallist in the women’s 4x100m relay at London 2012 and runner-up in the women’s two-man bobsleigh at Sochi 2014, Lauryn Williams is one of an elite group of athletes to have appeared on the podium at both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games.


Quick out of the blocks


A native of Pennsylvania (USA), Lauryn Williams showed great initial promise in track and field, particularly in the 100m, 200m and long jump, for which she holds the records at her high school to this day. While at the University of Miami, she developed into a top-class athlete, winning the 100m at the 2002 IAAF World Junior Championships in Kingston (JAM) in a time of 11.33 seconds. At the age of 20, she qualified for the Athens Games in 2004 by finishing 1/100th of a second behind sprinting superstar Gail Devers in the US trials.


A decade of track glory


On 21 August 2004, Williams won a silver medal in the 100m, recording an impressive 10.96 to follow Yulia Nesterenko (BLR) over the line. At the 2005 IAAF World Championships in Helsinki, the American sprinter prevailed in both the individual 100m and women’s 4x100m relay. Two years later at the 2007 Worlds in Osaka, she claimed another relay gold, a feat she then repeated at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, although she was not part of the quartet that ran in the final.


From track to ice


In the summer of 2013, injury forced Williams to bring the curtain down on her athletics career having achieved personal bests of personal bests of 10.88 in the 100m and 22.27 over 200m.A subsequent discussion with Lolo Jones, who had made headlines by joining the US national bobsleigh team while still a 100m hurdles star, convinced her to take part in the National Push Championships in Calgary. She duly excelled, opening the door to a new Olympic adventure.


Winter Games success


Following a marvellous FIBT World Cup campaign and just six months of training as a brakeman, Williams was selected to compete at the Sochi Games. In the two-woman event, held on 18 and 19 February 2014, she and Elana Meyers excelled in the USA-1 sled at the Sanki Sliding Centre, beating the push record three times and clinching a remarkable second spot behind defending champions Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyes (CAN), after coming very close to gold.


A rare double


That result sealed Williams’ place in history as only the fifth athlete, and the first American woman, to land medals at both the Summer and Winter Games. And she hints that her exploits on the ice are only just beginning. “Bobsleigh is now my family,” says the multi-talented sportswoman.

Winning more medals than any other athlete at PyeongChang 2018, five in total, Norwegian cross-country skiing idol Marit Bjørgen became the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, with a collection of 15 medals to her name. Eight of them are golds, equalling the record held by her compatriots Ole Einar Bjørndalen and Bjørn Daehlie, who won their titles in biathlon and cross-country respectively. Those records are just two of the many she has achieved during her remarkable career.


It started with the sprint


Bjørgen has won everything there is to win since embarking on her international career as a 19-year-old in 1999. The first of her 15 Olympic medals was a silver in the women’s 4x5km team relay at Salt Lake City 2002, when she formed part of a Norwegian quartet also featuring Bente Skari, Helde Pedersen and Anita Moan.


Bjørgen secured her maiden FIS World Cup win later that year in the freestyle sprint in Dusseldorf (GER), while a maiden world title came her way the following year in the same event in Val di Fiemme (ITA).


Though she started out as a sprint specialist and scored her first ten career wins in the freestyle and classical events thanks to her explosive power, Bjørgen expanded her repertoire to longer distances during the 2004/05 season, with yet more victories and podium finishes coming her way.


The greatest record in cross-country skiing


The Norwegian great added to her World Championship medal collection by pocketing three golds, a silver and a bronze in Oberstdorf (GER) in 2005. She followed up with four golds and a silver in Oslo-Holmenkollen (NOR) in 2011, a haul she repeated in Val di Fiemme two years later and to which she added two golds and a silver in Falun (SWE) in 2015 and four golds in Lahti in 2017. By end of her career she had amassed 26 World Championship medals, 18 of them golds.


She was just as prolific in the World Cup, taking the overall title in 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2015, winning six small crystal globes and amassing 184 top-three finishes, including 114 individual wins – another outright record. Remarkably, however, it was not until Vancouver 2010 that she won her first Olympic gold.


Medal rush in Vancouver


After a disappointing Turin 2006, where stomach pains restricted her to just the one medal – a silver in the 10km classical – Bjørgen bounced back in style at the Whistler Olympic Park four years later, climbing on to the podium in every event she entered.


She began with bronze in the 10km freestyle and then won three golds in a row (in the sprint, the 15km pursuit and the 4x5km team relay) before taking silver in the 30km classical, an event in which she finished just 0.3 seconds behind Poland’s Justyna Kowalczyk.


That impressive haul made her the most successful female athlete of the XXI Olympic Winter Games and led to her also collecting the Holmenkollen Medal, the highest distinction Nordic skiing has to offer.


More gold in Sochi


Her form undimmed by the time Sochi 2014 came around, the Norwegian successfully defended her Olympic 15km pursuit title and then partnered Ingvild Flugstad Ostberg to gold in the women’s team sprint.


She saved the best till last, getting the better of compatriots Therese Johaug and Kristin Stormer Steira to win the blue riband 30km freestyle event at her fourth attempt.


In winning her tenth Olympic medal, the Norwegian equalled the Soviet Union’s Raisa Smetanina and Italy’s Stefania Belmondo, both of them cross-country skiers. And in claiming her six Olympic title, she pulled level with the cross-country skier Lyubov Yegorova and the speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova (both of whom represented the former Soviet Union) as the most prolific female gold medallists in the history of the Winter Games.


The owner of more golds than Smetanina and Belmondo and more medals than Yegorova and Skoblikova, Bjoergen also became the most decorated female Winter Olympian of all time.


World Cup grand slam


Bjørgen began the 2014/15 FIS World Cup season by winning the one event absent from her extensive list of career honours: the Tour de Ski, the first leg of a World Cup grand slam that she completed by winning the distance and sprint crystal globes and the Nordic Opening title. Not surprisingly, the season ended with the Norwegian collecting her fourth big crystal globe.


Speaking on Norwegian TV in April 2015, Bjørgen announced that she was taking time out for a very good reason: “I have a little bombshell to drop here today: I’m going to be a mother in December. I plan to come back, though. My goal is the World Championships in Lahti.


On 26 December that year, she and partner Fred Borre Lundberg, the two-time Olympic Nordic combined champion, celebrated the arrival of a baby boy, Marius.


Going out on a high 


Bjørgen made the best possible return to the competitive arena at the 2017 World Championships in Lahti (FIN), winning the 10km classic, 15km skiathlon, 30km freestyle and the 4x5km relay with her Norwegian team-mates.


Though she was fast approaching 38, the medals kept coming her way at PyeongChang 2018, where she lived up to her nickname of “Gull Marit” (“Golden Marit”). She kicked off her fifth Olympic Winter Games with a silver in the skiathlon on the day after the Opening Ceremony, finishing seven seconds behind Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla.


Bjørgen then shared bronze with Finland’s Krista Parmakoski in a 10km freestyle race won by her compatriot Ragnhild Haga. In the 4x5km relay two days later, she skied a storming anchor leg to beat Sweden’s Stina Nilsson in a thrilling finish to claim gold for Norway and the seventh Olympic title of her career.


In her penultimate outing of the Games, she joined forces with Maiken Caspersen Falla to win bronze in a free sprint won by the USA. Then, on the final day of competition, Bjørgen broke clear of the field after 10km of the 30km classical to collect a joint-record eighth Olympic gold, putting her level with two other Norwegians: biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen and cross-country skier Bjørn Daehlie.


With her five medals, “Queen Marit” was the most decorated athlete of PyeongChang 2018, while her overall haul of 15 Olympic medals is two more than previous record holder Bjørndalen managed.


She also became the third most successful Olympian of all time – Summer and Winter – behind US swimmer Michael Phelps (28 medals, including 23 golds) and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina (18 medals, including nine golds). 


Legacy and retirement


“It’s incredible when I look back and see what I’ve done,” she said after her commanding 30km win. “I’ve had a wonderful career. These are my last Games and to finish off like this is just fantastic.”


Contemplating the legacy she would leave on hanging up her skis, Bjørgen said: “The future is bright for Norway, with more and more young athletes making it to the top. I also think that the reason why we’re so strong is that they have idols who’ve shown the way and who they can identify with. After these Games, we’re perhaps going to see more boys and girls coming through. If they’re doing cross-country or something else like Alpine skiing or skating, then it’s all good for the future.”


Bjørgen made the last competitive appearance of her stellar career at the Norwegian Championships on 6 April 2018, announcing that at the age of 38 she no longer had the motivation “to compete 100% for another season”. While her host of records will surely stand for a long time, her influence on her sport will endure even longer.

Coming together in the wake of Vancouver 2010, pair skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov struck up an instant rapport and wasted little time reaching the top. World champions in 2013 and the holders of the short programme, free skate and combined score world records, the Russian duo won an unprecedented two gold medals at Sochi 2014, taking the honours in the pairs event and the new team competition.


Olympic debut for Ukraine


Born in the Ukrainian city of Dniepropetrovsk, Tatiana Volosozhar represented her native country in partnership with Stanislav Morozov up to the age of 23. Appearing at two Olympic Winter Games together, they came 12th at Turin 2006 and eighth at Vancouver 2010, after which Morozov retired from competitive skating.


Instant chemistry


Morozov’s retirement left Volosozhar looking for a new partner, though she did not have to wait long to find one. St Petersburg-born Maxim Trankov, had enjoyed considerable success with Maria Mukhortova, with the pair winning the junior world title in 2005, finishing runners-up at the 2008 European Championships and then seventh at the Vancouver Games. Trankov had expressed an interest in skating with Volosozhar several years earlier. The two eventually teamed up in May 2010, forging an instant bond and taking the Russian title only five months later, though Volosozhar would have to wait a year before being allowed to represent Russia on the international scene. 


Bound for the top


The pair starred at the 2011 ISU World Figure Skating Championships in Moscow, taking second place behind Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy of Germany. “We weren’t even thinking of the silver,” said a delighted Volosozhar afterwards. “We thought that we might be able to get bronze, so this result has come as a complete surprise to us. The most amazing thing for us was the fantastic response we got from the spectators, even before our short programme, and I’ll never forget the standing ovation they gave us after our free exercise.” Coached by the experienced Nina Mozer, they were then bolstered by the recruitment of Volosozhar’s former partner Morozov, as assistant.


History in Sochi


Arriving at Sochi 2014 as reigning world champions and the holders of three world records, including the combined total, which they had taken out to 237.71 points, Volosozhar and Trankov got their Games off to the best possible start by helping Russia win gold in the new figure skating team competition. They then proceeded to dominate the pairs event, kicking off with a flawless short programme performed to music from Aram Katchaturian’s Masquerade, which brought them another new points record of 84.17. They followed up that display with a magnificent free skate to the music from Jesus Christ Superstar.


Clearly overcome with emotion as they ended their routine, they were showered with flowers by the crowd. “That was the toughest job of our lives, and we were under enormous pressure,” said Volosozhar and Trankov, who had become the first pair skaters to win two gold medals at the same Games. “We already had the gold from the team competition, but this is what we really came for. This is our life dream.”

Coming together in the wake of Vancouver 2010, pair skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov struck up an instant rapport and wasted little time reaching the top. World champions in 2013 and the holders of the short programme, free skate and combined score world records, the Russian duo won an unprecedented two gold medals at Sochi 2014, taking the honours in the pairs event and the new team competition. 


Junior champion


Hailing from St Petersburg, Maxim Trankov won the junior world title in 2005 with Maria Mukhortova, with the pair going on to finish runners-up at the 2008 European Championships and seventh at Vancouver 2010. Meanwhile, his future partner Tatiana Volosozhar, was skating with fellow Ukrainian Stanislav Morozov. After competing at two Olympic Winter Games together (finishing 12th at Turin 2006 and eighth at Vancouver 2010), Morozov retired from competitive skating.


Perfect chemistry


Morozov’s retirement left Volosozhar looking for a new partner. She did not have to wait long to find one. Trankov had expressed an interest in skating with her several years earlier and the two teamed up in May 2010, forging an instant bond and taking the Russian title only five months later. However, Volosozhar would have to wait a year before being allowed to represent Russia with Trankov on the international scene. 


An inexorable rise


They starred at the 2011 ISU World Figure Skating Championships in Moscow, taking second place behind Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy of Germany. Coached by the experienced Nina Mozer, they were then joined by Volosozhar’s former partner Morozov as the team’s assistant. The new pair were well and truly on their way and had a very clear objective in mind: to atone for Russia’s disappointing showing at Vancouver 2010, where not one of the country’s pairs made the podium.


A sign of things to come


“It’s us who put the pressure on each other. It’s something we do day after day,” said Trankov, commenting on the drive and determination that has made the pair contenders at every major competition. After winning silver medals again at the 2012 Worlds in Nice, they finally went one better at London (CAN) in 2013, while also taking the European crowns in both seasons and winning the final of the 2013 ISU Grand Prix in Sochi. In taking that title in Canada they set world records with their free skate and combined scores, and then raised the bar even higher at Skate America in Detroit in October 2013, posting new records of 83.05 points in the short and 154.66 in the free, giving them a combined total of 237.71. 


Hitting the heights in Sochi


When Sochi 2014 came around, Volosozhar and Trankov got their Games off to the best possible start by winning the new figure skating team competition for Russia. They then proceeded to dominate the pairs event, kicking off with a flawless short programme performed to the music of Aram Katchaturian’s Masquerade, which brought them another new points record of 84.17. They backed that display up with a magnificent free skate, with Jesus Christ Superstar providing the musical backdrop this time. Clearly overcome with emotion as they ended their routine, they were showered with flowers by the crowd. “That was the toughest job of our lives, and we were under enormous pressure,” said Volosozhar and Trankov, who had become the first pair skaters to win two gold medals at the same Games. “We already had the gold from the team competition, but this is what we really came for.

Wolfgang and Andréas Linger started practising luge on the Igls Olympic track, used for the Innsbruck Games in 1964 and 1976. These two brothers, who are not twins, started out in the one-man events. It was only five years later that they teamed up. At the 2002 Games, the Linger brothers became part of the world luge elite, but did not do enough to win any titles. After two good races, they finished sixth at the Salt Lake City Games.


The Cesana track - cursed, then blessed


The following year was a revelation – firstly coming fourth in the World Cup, they went on to dominate all their opponents to win the 2003 World Championship title on the Sigulda track in Latvia. But everything looked as if it was coming to an end in 2005 at Cesana in Italy, on the future Olympic track, where they came off in the last bend but one.


Wolfgang had a higher price to pay, fracturing his ankle and fibula. But his passion for luge was too great. He rejoined the circuit the following year with his brother. The two brothers had another rendezvous with Cesana for the Turin Olympic Games in 2006. This time, they did not come off the track; they won the first race and finished second in the next one. It was a victory for the Austrian brothers – they were Olympic champions!


Rising to the major challenges


Between 2006 and 2010, the Linger brothers were still near the top, but did not win any major victories. Arriving in Vancouver, they knew that it was not going to be easy and that their opponents were very strong. The Latvians, Germans, Italians and Americans were bound to be formidable competitors.


On 17 February, the two heats of the doubles event were held. From the first intermediate times, the two Austrians were in the lead. They passed the finish line with an average time of 135 kmh. The Latvian Sic brothers came in eight-hundredths of a second behind then, followed by the German pair 23-hundredths of a second later. There was one heat left to race, and the pressure was on Wolfgang and Andréas. They made a perfect start and did not commit a single error on the whole run. Although slower than in the first heat, they were still in the lead in this second round. There was no doubt that they were the champions today, winning their second gold medal. They were the first lugers to retain their Olympic title in this event since the East Germans, Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn, in 1976 and 1980.

David Boudia is the United States' most successful diver of the 21st century, winning four medals from three Olympic Games. When he won 10-metre platform gold at London 2012, Boudia became the first male American Olympic champion in diving since Mark Lenzi won 3m gold 20 years earlier.


Boudia won his first major international medal in 2007, taking Pan Am Games gold and World Championships bronze in synchro diving alongside Thomas Finchum. An Olympic appearance followed in Beijing, before further success at World Championships level with silvers in 2009 and 2011.


But the big breakthrough came in the British capital in 2012, when he came from 18th in the preliminaries – the last diver not to be eliminated – to stun world champion Qiu Bo and home favourite Tom Daley in the 10m platform final. It was the first diving gold medal for the U.S. since Laura Wilkinson's women's 10m gold in 2000.


After two more medals – silver and bronze – in Rio four years later, Boudia took time off from diving. Upon his return to competition, a serious concussion suffered after a training incident led the diver to change tack, switching to the lower 3m springboard. ""Training 10m was a little mundane and pushing the 3m springboard added some extra motivation,"" he said.

The winner of seven Olympic medals (five of them gold) and 14 World Championship medals (eight of them gold), China’s Wu Minxia is the most decorated female athlete in the history of diving. As well as collecting four consecutive Olympic 3m synchronised springboard titles between Athens 2004 and Rio 2016 with three different partners, she also won the 3m individual springboard gold at London 2012. 


The quest for individual gold


Wu Minxia’s long and hugely successful Olympic career began at Athens 2004. Partnering Guo Jingjing, she won gold in the 3m women’s synchronised springboard event, a title the duo retained at Beijing 2008, where Guo added another individual 3m springboard title to go with the one she had pocketed in the Greek capital four years earlier.Spotted at a very early age but hampered on her rise to the top by a string of injuries, Wu grew accustomed to being in Guo’s shadow. However, she never gave up hope of fulfilling the dream she had pursued since her childhood, when she would watch on TV as China’s divers soared to success on the Olympic stage, resolving to follow the trail they blazed.After taking individual 3m springboard silver behind Guo in Athens and collecting the bronze in Beijing, when Russia’s Yuliya Pakhalina split the Chinese duo, the ambitious Wu was determined to kick on and finally make that dream a reality.


A long-awaited world title


The turning point in her career came in 2011, a year that began with Guo announcing her retirement after amassing six Olympic medals, four of them gold, a record unrivalled at the time. Together Guo and Wu had also won four 3m synchronised springboard world titles (in 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009), and Wu would win another in Shanghai in 2011 with new partner He Zi. As a sign of things to come, Wu also claimed her one and only world 3m individual title that year, finishing ahead of He in a Chinese one-two.


Coronation in London 


There would be identical outcomes at London 2012, where Wu and He eased to synchronised springboard gold, top-scoring with each of their five dives to rack up a total of 346.20 points and win by a distance from USA’s Kelci Bryant and Abigail Johnston, and the Canadian duo of Jennifer Abel and Emilie Heymans. It was Wu’s third consecutive Olympic gold in the event. Held over three days, Wu dominating proceedings in the preliminary round of the individual 3m springboard competition  The 26-year-old was out in front again in the following day’s semi-finals, and then closed out the competition a day later with five precise dives to win what would be her first and last individual Olympic gold. The only competitor to score in excess of 85 marks – for her third and fifth dives – and to exceed 400 points in total, Wu was a comfortable winner ahead of team-mate He and Mexico’s Laura Sanchez. “I think we all have a dream, and I chose diving, with my aim being to make a difference,” she said at the time. “I never gave up on that dream, though I haven’t achieved this on my own. So many people have supported me, from my family and my coach, to a whole lot of other people behind the scenes.” In winning her sixth Olympic medal, Wu joined the great Guo at the pinnacle of women’s diving, while FINA named her Athlete of the Year in the female diving category in both 2011 and 2012. 


A new partner, more success 


Wu then joined forces with Shi Tingmao in the 3m synchro event, with the pair taking the world title in Barcelona (ESP) in 2013 and retaining it in Kazan (RUS) two years later. In the process, Wu became the first diver in history to win seven world golds in the event, with three different partners. “I’m getting older and it takes longer for me to recover now,” she said after her Kazan triumph. “I need to be efficient when I train and try to avoid picking up injuries. The synchronised was my only event here, and it’s always difficult to win the gold.” 


A matchless record


Wu came close to missing out on Rio 2016 after suffering a leg injury two months before the Games. She made the trip but sat out the individual competition, looking on as her current synchro partner Shi won by a distance from her former partner He. One week later, Wu was back in action alongside Shi to win her fourth consecutive synchronised gold from Italy’s Tania Gagnotto and Francesca Dallapé and Australia’s Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith. In climbing to the top of another Olympic podium, Wu joined her compatriot Chen Ruolin – who won a third consecutive 10m synchro title in Rio – on five diving golds, one more than American great Greg Louganis and her “big sister” Guo. Wu holds the distinctions, however, of being the most decorated Olympic diver in history with seven medals and the oldest woman to win Olympic gold in the sport.


Bowing out


On 22 December 2016, Wu announced her retirement from competitive diving at the age of 31. “Reluctantly, it’s time to call it a day,” she said live on Chinese TV. “The story of Chinese diving didn’t start with me and it won’t end with me. I am really sorry, but my physical condition does not allow me to continue training. I’ve always feared this day coming.” Though maybe not the first or the last great Chinese diver to grace the boards, Wu will no doubt remain the most successful for many years to come.

Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott claimed Britain’s first-ever gold medal in the two-man canoe slalom at London 2012 with a breathtaking performance – and it was a victory to savour, coming after years of frustration and setbacks.


The pair, ranked sixth in the world, pulled out a flawless run on the 25-gate 300m course to record a shock win – leaving themselves speechless and turning the tables on their long-standing Brit rivals David Florence and Richard Hounslow, who took silver.


Baillie and Stott went into the final as the slowest pair but navigated the rapids without incurring penalties, emerging with a time of 106.41. Having gone first they had to play a waiting game. As each rival team paddled through the undulating, twisting course the tension mounted, and the sense that a shock was on the cards grew.


Frenchmen Gauthier Klauss and Matthieu Peche caused a seismic roar from the 12,000-strong crowd when they clipped a pole and incurred a two-second penalty, thus ensuring Britain a place in the top three. But when three-time Olympic champions Pavol and Peter Hochschorner of Slovakia took their run, and finished almost two seconds slower than Baillie and Stott, the unthinkable happened. At the end of the final the British canoeists leapt into the water to celebrate.


It was a dream that so nearly didn’t come to pass. The two men, both 33, have been friends for more than a decade and have been competing in the C2 since the end of the Athens Olympics in 2004. 


But little had gone to plan in their career on the water. The low-point of their careers came in 2011 when Stott, from Bedford in England, and Baillie, from Aberdeen in Scotland, both suffered serious injuries.


Former kayak racers, they took bronze as a team at the World Championships in 2009 and 2011, and recorded the same results in the European contests in 2009 and 2010. But little had gone to plan in their career on the water. The low-point of their careers came in 2011 when Stott, from Bedford in England, and Baillie, from Aberdeen in Scotland, both suffered serious injuries.


Baillie broke his collarbone so badly in a mountain-biking accident that he required surgery and at one point feared his days in a canoe were numbered. When Stott badly dislocated his shoulder paddling on the Olympic course it seemed they were doomed to miss the Games. However, with enormous amounts of grit and hard work, they made a comeback, and won gold in the European Canoe Slalom Championships in Augsburg, Germany, one month before the 2012 Games. Then came their miracle win at Lee Valley White Water Centre.


After winning gold, Stott told reporters: “It could have been a disaster and now it’s a dream. There is nothing taken for granted in this sport and getting to the final was amazing.” Baillie added: “I don't think surreal really covers it. It's crazy. I thought our run might be good enough for a medal, but I didn't expect that. It’s a topsy-turvy sport.”

David Florence followed his father, a former Scottish champion, into canoeing and took part in his first competition at the age of 15. He grew up on the same Edinburgh street as Chris Hoy and attended Stewart’s Melville College before studying Mathematical Physics at the University of Nottingham. Florence made his World Championship début in 2005 and was runner-up in the season long World Cup series two years later. A two-second penalty that Florence incurred on the first run of the Olympic final was the difference between first and second place and meant that he would have to settle for silver and not gold. He was World Cup champion in 2009 but did not win a World Championship medal until 2011, after adding Canadian doubles to his usual singles campaign, he was a member of the British team that won a bronze medal in the C-2 team event, and with Richard Hounslow, he won a silver medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in the C-2 event, and in competing in Rio Florence became the first British slalom canoeist to appear in three successive Games. At the 2013 World Championships in Praha, he became the first man for 60 years to win C-1 and C-2 titles in the same year and also the first Briton to win both titles. He retained his C-1 title on his home course at the Lee Valley White Water Centre in 2015. Florence is an avid bagpipe player and is an all-round sportsman, playing tennis and golf, and he also enjoys skiing. He also learnt Mandarin Chinese before the Beijing Olympics.

Slovakian twin brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner won three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the C-2 canoe double competition between 2000 and 2008. They are determined to make up for the disappointment of London 2012 – where they had to make do with bronze – by adding to their golden haul at Rio 2016.


Canoeing pedigree


Peter and Pavol Hochschorner were born into a family of canoeing enthusiasts in Bratislava (SVK); their father, who is also their coach, and mother had both represented Czechoslovakia in the slalom, while their sister, who works as their manager, has competed in sprint events for Slovakia. In fact, it was in that discipline that the twins initially took to the water, before opting for the intensity of whitewater slaloming. 





“We have never raced with anyone else, so we have built up our own communication,” Peter explained at London 2012. “Most of the time we are just synchronised.”


Glory in Sydney


As they prepared for the final of the Olympic men’s slalom C-2 competition on 20 September 2000 at Penrith Whitewater Stadium near Sydney, Pavol and Peter, both 21, were in a confident mood, having previously been twice crowned European champions (in 1998 and 2000) and having won a silver medal at the 1999 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships.


The brothers proceeded to produce two excellent runs, particularly second time out, where their coordination and fluidity were on full display in a faultless performance. With the two fastest times, they claimed their first Olympic title, finishing comfortably ahead of Krzysztof Kołomański and Michał Staniszewski (POL). 


In the years between Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004, they continued to achieve striking results, amassing victories in several ICF Canoe Slalom World Cups, the 2002 ECA European Championships and the 2002 World Championships.


Gold in Athens and Beijing


On 19 August 2004 at the Hellenikon Olympic Complex to the south of Athens, Pavol and Peter put in a series of marvellous displays, impressing the watching public by posting the fastest times of the preliminary round, semi-final and final. 


Further successes followed in the World Cup, European Championships and World Championships (in 2007 and 2009), and in the 2008 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. In the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, they again emerged from the qualifying round with the best time, but they fell to second position after their semi-final run. On 15 August, however, the Hochschorners surged to a third successive Olympic victory, becoming the first competitors to achieve such a feat in the C-2 category.


London letdown


During the London Games in 2012, the dominant Slovakian pair were taken by surprise by the potency of the challenges provided by the British duos of Timothy Baillie/Etienne Stott and David Florence/Richard Hounslow at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, and were forced to settle for the bronze medal after incurring a two-second penalty for hitting a slalom gate. 


“It was a horrible sensation in London, as we didn’t perform well and we knew that one penalty could cost us a place on the podium,” said Peter. “But in the end, we were happy to have won a medal for Slovakia.”


Focus on Rio


The nine-time European champions and six-time world champions, who boast eight other medals at the Worlds and have topped the overall World Cup standings a record 10 times, will go in search of a fifth Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when they will be 36 years of age. 


“The domestic qualifiers for the Rio Games will be very intense, as we have many talented Slovakian canoeists,” said Pavol. “Once we have guaranteed our place, it would be great to win gold again. There’s a series of young competitors in our category and it will be interesting to face them. We will try to make our experience count.”

Behind the untouchable pair of Anastasiya Dayvdova and Anastasiya Yermakova, the Spanish duo placed second. They repeated that performance as a part of the team competition, again finishing behind Russia. Fuentes claimed three European gold medals prior to the Olympics, only missing the gold in the solo competition, which was taken by her partner Mengual.

Iain Percy learnt to sail at the age of four and was only seventeen when he made his début at the Laser Class European Championships. He campaigned in the Laser Class and finished fifth in the 1996 World championships but missed selection for the 1996 Olympic Games. A switch to the Finn Class followed and he went on to win the European Championship in 1998. Percy spent many months training and competing off Sydney in the years preceding the 2000 Olympics and it paid off handsomely when he won the Olympic title so comfortably that he did not even have to compete in the final race of the series. He swapped classes again in 2001 to the two-man Star boat but, although he and partner Steve Mitchell were world champions in 2002, they could not translate that success to the Athens Games. Percy then took a year away from Olympic class sailing to become helm of the Italian-owned America’s Cup challenger +39 Challenge, but they finished way down the list of qualifiers in the Luis Vutton Challenge Series and failed to qualify. He returned to Star class racing and a year before the Beijing Games teamed up with lifelong friend Andrew Simpson. Initial results were below par but at the 2008 Olympics they won the gold medal with their performance in the final race. They added the 2010 World Championship gold to their medal collection and remain one of the world’s top crews. The pair joined the crew of the British America’s Cup challenger, Team Origin, under the helm of Ben Ainslie, but the team announced it was abandoning its challenge for the 2013 Cup. The Percy-Simpson partnership was unbreakable and at the London 2012 Olympics they won the silver medal. It was Iain’s third Olympic medal as he became only the third Briton after Rodney Pattisson and Ben Ainslie to win three Olympic sailing medals.


After the 2012 Olympics Iain and Andrew joined the Artemis Racing America’s Cup team, but that is when the Percy-Simpson partnership was sadly brought to an abrupt end following a tragic accident whilst training in San Francisco Bay, in which Andrew Simpson drowned. The team continued, and under Iain’s guidance they reached the semi-final of the Luis Vutton Cup, only to lose to the Italian challenger.

Andrew Simpson, also known as Bart Simpson after the popular cartoon character, was known as one of the world’s best sailors in the Laser and Finn classes but for two Olympics running his role was limited to that of training partner to two men, Iain Percy in 2000 and Ben Ainslie in 2004, who both became Olympic champion. In 2008, after both men had met with mixed results in other boats, he teamed up with Iain Percy to campaign for Olympic selection in the Star class. The two men had been close friends since boyhood but they struggled in their early events and placed 52nd at the World Championships in 2008. By Beijing the combination clicked together and they won the Olympic title in a desperately close competition against the Swedish duo. The pair continued their successful ways by winning a silver medal at the 2009 European Championships and a gold medal at the World Championships in 2010. Their medal-winning streak was broken in 2011 when Percy suffered a back injury that led to their withdrawal from the World Championships. The duo narrowly failed to defend their Olympic title on home waters at Weymouth in 2012 when they lost out on gold after a final race duel with the Brazilian crew wrecked both teams chances and let Sweden take the championship. Following the London Games Simpson joined the crew of the Swedish America’s Cup challenge. Whilst training in San Francisco Bay in May 2013 he became trapped under the boat after a capsize and could not be revived by paramedics after spending ten minutes underwater.


In memory of his friend, Iain Percy founded the Andrew Simpson Sailing Foundation in 2013, with the aim of helping sailors at the grass roots level of the sport, and also to provide opportunities to deserving children who would otherwise not get the opportunity to enjoy the thrill of sailing,

Robert Scheidt has collected medals at each of the five editions of the Olympic Games in which he has competed, a haul that makes him the joint highest medal winner in the history of Olympic sailing along with compatriot Torben Grael and Great Britain’s Ben Ainslie


From Optimist to Laser


Born in Sao Paulo, Robert Scheidt has been winning races since he was a child, becoming South American champion in the Optimist class at the age of only 11. A gifted tennis player, he nevertheless decided to devote all his energies to sailing in 1986, a year in which he was selected to represent Brazil at the Optimist World Championship. After switching to Snipe, Scheidt then moved into the Olympic sailing class Laser, taking the 1991 junior world title in Scotland by winning all but one of the 11 races.


From Atlanta to Athens


On graduating to senior level, he won his first world title in Tenerife (ESP) in 1995 and a second the following year in Cape Town (RSA). A few months later came the first of his two Olympic golds, at Atlanta 1996, where he finished in the top three in every one of the 11 races to win convincingly from Ainslie. The British sailor gained revenge at Sydney 2000, leaving Scheidt to pick up silver. Choosing to stay in Laser, the Brazilian showcased his gift for bouncing back four years later in Athens, mastering the light winds at the Agios Kosmas Olympic Sailing Centre to land a second gold and his third medal in consecutive Games.


From Beijing to London


It was then that Scheidt decided to try his hand at Star, the king of all Olympic sailing classes. Partnering Bruno Prada, he won another silver at Beijing 2008, where he also had the honour of carrying the national flag at the opening ceremony, and added a bronze to his medal collection at London 2012. His record of two golds, two silvers and that one bronze has taken him ahead of Torben Grael as Brazil’s greatest Olympic sailor of all time and one of the country’s most successful athletes ever. In the meantime, he has also won 17 world championship medals, 12 of them golds, the last of them coming in the Laser class in 2013.


The fire still burns


“I think these five Olympic Games represent a life dedicated to sport, a life in which I have invested all my energies and all my time in making the absolute most of my potential as an athlete,” says Scheidt. “I am very proud of that, because each time has been a different story for me. You have to keep the flame inside you alive.” By constantly reinventing himself, renewing his objectives at each step of his career and continually looking forward in a bid to stay competitive, Scheidt has been able to put together one of the great Olympic careers.

Katalin Kovács started canoeing with her sisters and first competed for Budapesti Spartacus SC. She won her first medals at the 1993 European Junior Championships with silver in K-2 500 as well as in K-4 500 and became a member of the national team in 1995. In 1996 she was already nominated as a reserve for the Atlanta Olympics and in 1997, after changing to Újpesti TE, won her first medals on the senior level with two silvers at the European Championships as well as one silver at the World Championships. She won her first World title with gold in the 1998 K-4 200 metres. Her first Olympic medals came in 2000 when she won two silver medals. The following years she won nine gold medals at the 2001, 2002, and 2003 World Championships and for the 2004 Olympics she paired with Natasa Janics. This partnership resulted in Kovács' first Olympic gold medal when they won the K-2 500 metres.


At the next two World Championships Kovács and Janics won three gold medals in 2005 and six gold medals in 2006, all in K-2 or K-4 events. At the 2006 European Championships they also won six golds in K-2 and K-4 events, in the 200 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. They did not compete together at the 2007 Worlds – nevertheless Kovács also won two gold and two silver – but paired again for the 2008 Olympics. In Beijing they successfully defended their K-2 500 m title and were also members of the silver medal winning K-4 500 m team. At the following two Worlds Kovács won two K-1 titles in 2009 and, with Janics, two more golds in 2009 and 2010. When Janics took a break in 2011 due to pregnancy, Kovács paired with Danuta Kozák for the Worlds and again won two gold medals. In total Kovács has collected 31 gold, six silver, and three bronze medals at the World Championships and 26 golds and 17 silvers at the European Championships.

Nataša Janić was born to Serbian-Croatian parents, and her father Milan Janić won silver at the 1984 Olympics in kayak. She won her first medal at the 2000 European Junior Championships with gold in K-1 500. Her first Olympic participation in the same year, still only 18-years-old, ended with a fourth place in the K-1 500, as she represented Serbia and Montenegro. After changing her nationality to Hungary, and now competing under the name Natasa Janics, she won her first medals in 2002 with silver in K-4 200 at the European Championships and gold in the same event at the World Championships. After winning another gold medal at the 2003 Worlds (in K-4 1000) she paired with Katalin Kovács for the 2004 Olympics. After winning gold in the K-1 500 Janics also won gold with Kovács in the K-2 500 only one hour later.


At the next two World Championships Kovács and Janics won three gold medals in 2005 and six gold medals in 2006, all in K-2 or K-4 events.

After hitting a career high in winning Olympic gold in the coxless pairs on home water at London 2012, British rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning went on to dominate their event and retain their title at Rio 2016. Both retired after Rio, but after having three children and being inspired to get back in shape during the pandemic lockdown in 2020, Glover returned to elite sport and competed at Tokyo 2020 (in 2021) with new partner Polly Swann, finishing fourth in the final and just missing out on a medal.


An unlikely duo


It was only in 2008, four years before the London Games, that Heather Stanning and Helen Glover had their first taste of international rowing. Born on 26 January 1985 in Yeovil, Somerset, Stanning had originally turned her back on sport to focus on her military career, serving in Afghanistan as an officer in the Royal Artillery. Meanwhile, her future rowing partner Glover, who was born on 17 June 1986 in Truro, Cornwall, was a PE teacher trying to break into Great Britain’s Olympic hockey team.   


One of 4,000 people responding to a national campaign to unearth sporting talent, which was headed up by five-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Steve Redgrave, Glover earned selection for the rowing programme. For her part, Stanning was moved to pursue her ambitions in the sport after watching the rowing competitions at Beijing 2008, deciding that she still had goals to fulfil and to push herself to the limit to achieve them.  


Hitting their stroke


The British duo’s rise to the top began when the coach Paul Stannard put them together in the coxless pairs in 2010. Though they came away empty-handed from their first World Cup regattas that year, the gap separating them from more established pairs ahead was relatively small. Despite Glover’s lack of experience and the fact their partnership was still in its infancy, they improved so rapidly that they won silver at their maiden World Championships that November, on Lake Karapiro in New Zealand.   


Home sweet home


Devoting their energies entirely to their sport ever since, Glover and Stanning set about preparing for the Olympic Games London 2012. In the season leading up to that date with destiny, they won every round of the FISA World Rowing Cup they contested and were favourites by the time they lined up for the start of the coxless pair Olympic final at Eton Dorney on 1 August 2012, having set a Games record of 6:57.29 in winning their heat.   


With 32,000 expectant spectators in the stands, the pressure on them to win Great Britain’s first gold of its home Games and the first ever for British women’s rowing was intense.  


Living the dream


Recalling her thoughts as the home crowd voiced their encouragement at the start line, Glover said: “I remember the feeling was quite ready, just quite calm.” Adding her recollections, partner Stanning said: “I think it’s always quite nice in this part of the race because you’ve gone out at the start, you’ve got an idea of what’s going on and then you can relax into the race a little bit.”  


Jumping into an early lead, the British boat quickly pulled away from the rest of the field and stayed well ahead all the way to the finish line. Settling to 36 strokes a minute, Glover and Stanning passed the 1,000m marker in a time of 3:39.5, some 3.5 seconds clear of New Zealand’s Juliette Haigh and Rebecca Scown, with Australia’s Kate Hornsey and Sarah Tait 6.2 adrift of the leaders.  


As the finish line approached so the noise from the crowd increased, as Stanning recalled: “Normally you only hear people in the last 250 metres. So having that extra 500 metres of people, it kind of swallows up that bit of the race quite quickly.”   


The lead over the Kiwis had grown to five seconds with 500m remaining, with Glover and Stanning eventually easing over the line to spark scenes of great celebration in the stands. Behind them, a little over two seconds adrift, the Australian pair took silver, having overhauled the New Zealanders in the sprint for the line.  


“I just remember feeling utter relief because we’d won every race that season coming up to it,” said Glover. “I was so tired but so excited and I couldn’t even lift myself to get up off my seat or get back on my seat,” added Stanning. The pair looked up to see their coaches waving excitedly at them from the bank. “That was one of the nicest moments actually just seeing them,” recalled Glover. “No matter what happens for the rest of my life, I’ve done something I can be proud of forever. No one can ever take that away from me.”  


Just the start


London 2012 was just the start for the pair, however. When Stanning then took a break from rowing to return to the armed forces, Glover teamed up with Polly Swan to win her maiden world title in Chungju (KOR) in 2013. A year later, the Olympic champions were reunited and showed they had lost none of their magic by setting a new coxless pair world record of 6:50.61 in becoming world champions in Amsterdam. Another world title followed in Aiguebelette (FRA) in 2015, with the British duo also winning three consecutive European crowns between 2014 and 2016.   


Comfortable winners of the British Olympic trial in March 2016, the all-conquering Glover and Stanning headed to Rio as the reigning Olympic, world and European champions and very firm favourites to retain their title in Brazil.  


A procession in Rio


The British pair eased through their heats in Rio. The Olympic and world record holders over 2,000m, they defended their title in style, leading the final from start to finish and holding a four-second lead over Denmark’s Hedvig Rasmussen and Anne Andersen at the halfway stage. The Danes were caught by New Zealand’s Genevieve Behrens and Rebecca Scown in the closing stages, with the Kiwis taking silver, 1.24 seconds behind the invincible Glover and Stanning.  


""I just want to find our coach and family and friends because it’s all for them. I want to say thank you,” said Glover afterwards, while a delighted Stanning was moved to compare their second triumph to the first: “I know it was a home Games and there’s nothing more special, but this was defending a title. This is not being good once, it’s being good every day, every race. It just feels so good with all the pressure we put on ourselves. It’s pretty immense.”


Retirement and return


Glover and Stanning retired after Rio, with Glover giving birth to children in 2018 and 2020. After giving birth to twins in January 2020, the pandemic hit, and during lockdown she was inspired to resume training to try to return to elite sport.


The return alongside new partner Polly Swann was a successful one as the coxless pair crew won European gold in 2021, before finishing fourth in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic final.

Sarah Outhwaite was born in Perth and began rowing when only 9-years-old. She studied environmental science and agriculture in school, but continued to row, making her first international appearance at the 2000 World Juniors, when she won a silver in the junior women’s coxless four. She competed at three Olympics (2004-12), the first as Sarah Outhwaite, and the final two as Sarah Tait, finally winning an Olympic medal at London with a silver in the coxless pairs. At the senior international level her greatest victory came in winning a gold medal in the eights at the 2005 World Championships. She added a silver medal in the coxless pairs at that event and returned to add a bronze in coxless pairs at the 2011 Worlds.


After her marriage to Bill Tait, Outhwaite-Tait had two children, a girl in 2009 and a boy in 2013. Shortly after the second pregnancy she was diagnosed with cervical (uterine) cancer. She retired from rowing in February 2014 to concentrate on fighting the disease but it took her life when she was only 33-years-old.

A keen sportsman, Zac Purchase started rowing in 1997 while at King’s College, Worcester, and came to prominence when he was World Under-23 lightweight single sculls champion in 2005. By the end of the year he had added a silver medal in the senior World Championships and established himself as an up-and-coming talent. This talent was revealed conclusively in front of a home crowd at the 2006 World Championships when he rowed away from his rivals to record an easy victory. Since the lightweight single sculls is not an Olympic event British coaches had to search for someone to partner Purchase when to he moved to the doubles and found him in the form of Mark Hunter. The pair were never off the podium in their first season together and won a bronze at their first World Championships in 2007 but this was nothing compared to 2008. Purchase and Hunter won all three races of the World Cup series to arrive at the Olympics as overwhelming favourites and backed this up in Beijing to win Olympic gold. After a year away from the sport the pair returned in 2010 and has won both the 2010 and 2011 World Championships. They were under pressure to win their second Olympic gold medal in 2012 and just when they looked to have victory in sight, saw it snatched away from them on the line by the winning Danish pair. The month after the Olympics, Purchase married his long-time girlfriend, and fellow rower, Felicity “Fliss” Hill in St. Paul’s Cathedral. He then took 18 months away from the sport before returning in 2014 with the intention of joining the heavyweight squad but that proved fruitless and he announced his retirement soon afterwards. An excellent saxophonist, Purchase performed live on television at the 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards ceremony.

From a less privileged background than the majority of British rowers, Mark Hunter’s early life was centered around the river Thames. He learnt to row on the river as a member of the Poplar Blackwall & District Rowing Club and at 16 was apprenticed to be a Thames waterman with the intent on pursuing a career ferrying passengers along the river. After being a regular member of the national junior and under-23 programmes he progressed to the senior team in 2001, dropping into the lightweight category in the process. He was a member of the lightweight eight that reached the final of the 2001 World Championships but thereafter switched to the four, an Olympic class, in preparation for the Athens Olympics. The crew had a modicum of success on the road to Athens but had to be content with a victory in the C final and a lowly 13th place overall at the 2004 Games. In 2007 he was chosen to partner reigning world lightweight single sculls champion Zac Purchase in a double with the intent of contesting the 2008 Olympics. The pairing met with immediate success and were bronze medallists at their first World Championship together. Hunter and Purchase then maintained a perfect record throughout the 2008 season and won every race they contested up to and including the Olympic final. He then spent a year as an assistant coach at UCLA in California before returning to action in 2010. The duo won two further world titles in 2010 and 2011, when Mark was the British Olympic Association’s Olympic athlete of the year for rowing. Hunter and Purchase looked like retaining their Olympic title in 2012 and had victory in their sights until it was snatched form them in the final stages of a dramatic race by 6/10ths of a second. It was Hunter’s last major competition because he announced his retirement at Henley on the opening day of the 2013 Regatta, when he was also elected as a Henley steward. In February 2014 he was made the programme director at London Youth Rowing


After qualifying as a Waterman & Lighterman on the River Thames in 2002, Hunter became a Freeman of the Thames and as an apprentice in 2000, teamed up with John Dwan to win the commemorative Millennium Coat and Badge special double sculls race. Hunter is a keen all-round sportsman and likes football, cycling, badminton and swimming, and is a life-long supporter of West Ham United Football Club.

In an Olympic career that spanned five editions of the Games, beginning with a silver in the quadruple sculls at Sydney 2000 and ending with another in the double sculls at Rio 2016, British rower Dame Katherine Grainger collected a medal at each of her appearances, including double sculls gold with Anna Watkins at London 2012. That makes her Great Britain’s most decorated female Olympian.


Silver in Sydney


Born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Katherine Grainger took up rowing at the age of 18, and won her first major medal in the eight at the 1997 World Championships in Aiguebelette (FRA), where she helped Great Britain collect bronze. She made her Olympic debut at Sydney 2000, where she teamed up with Guin and Miriam Batten, and Gillian Lindsay to win silver in the quadruple sculls behind Germany. It was the first medal of her storied association with the Games.


Yet more silver


Grainger then joined forces with Catherine Bishop in the coxless pair, with the duo winning the world title in Milan in 2003 and going on to collect silver behind Romania’s invincible Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu at Athens 2004.


That second Olympic silver was followed by a third four years later in Beijing, where Grainger, Annabel Vernon, Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton were narrowly beaten by the Chinese quartet in the quadruple sculls, an event in which the Scottish rower had helped Great Britain win three consecutive world titles between 2005 and 2007. 


A winning combination


In 2010, Grainger linked up with Cambridge University rower Anna Watkins in the double sculls, the pair proving such an effective partnership that they went 23 races unbeaten, winning back-to-back world titles in 2010 and 2011 to take the Scot’s haul of world golds to six. With their powerful, instinctive sprint finish, boundless confidence and graceful and perfectly synchronised stroke, Grainger and Watkins were a perfect match on the water.


Wait for gold ends


Grainger was 36 by the time she set off in search of Olympic medal number four on home water at London 2012, with Watkins again in the boat with her. Lining up in the double sculls final in blustery conditions at Eton Dorney, the British pair took an early lead from Australia’s Brooke Pratley and Kim Crow and stretched it to half a length by the 500m mark.


Grainger and Watkins were still forcing the pace at the halfway stage and maintained it to record a famous and much-celebrated victory by a length. The long-awaited gold cemented the Scot’s status as one of the most gifted rowers of all time and erased memories of the narrow defeat to the Chinese four years earlier, which had led her to contemplate retirement.


“Worth the wait,” said Grainger, after receiving a congratulatory hug from fellow British rowing legend Sir Steve Redgrave. “Steve promised me there’d be tears of joy this time, which there are. I feel this medal of all of them is the people’s medal. I feel so many people have been behind me and supported me and wanted this for me as much as I have.


“It’s the fulfilment of a lot of blood, sweat and tears but it doesn’t all sink in. Any Olympic medal is a phenomenal achievement but having had three in the past I wanted a gold one to complete the collection.”


Time for a break


Taking a two-year sabbatical from rowing, Grainger completed a PhD in criminal psychology at King’s College, London, did a bit of TV commentary work and wrote an autobiography entitled Dreams Do Come True. In late 2014, however, having been made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the previous year, she decided to return to the British rowing team. And despite turning 40, Grainger, who was also named chancellor of Oxford Brookes University in March 2015, managed to qualify for her fifth straight Games, in the double sculls. Her new partner, Victoria Thornley, was 12 years her junior.


A silver swansong in Rio


After placing second in both their heat and their semi-final, Grainger and Thornley set off in search of gold in the final, where they would fight it out with Poland’s Magdalena Fularczyk-Kozłowska and Natalia Mataj.


In the lead at 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m, where they held an advantage of 1.25 seconds, the British duo were reeled in by their Polish rivals in the closing 200m and finished nearly a second off the pace in second, well ahead of Lithuania’s Donata Vištartaitė and Milda Valčiukaitė in third.


“Mum and Dad, I promise: I will never put you through that again,” announced Grainger immediately after making it five medals in five Games to set a new British record. “They’ve been through it five times with me. They weren’t sure if coming back was the right thing for me and they’ve been so supportive since I did. We all know it was the right decision now. But at the same time, I think maybe that’s enough.” 


                                    The veteran added: “I have had my happiest and hardest days on the water. The closest friendships I’ve made have been through this sport and it’s hard to imagine it not being my life in some way. I’ll never leave it and it’ll never leave me but I look forward to not setting my alarm for dawn and waking up as late as I want.”

In retaining their Olympic coxless pairs title at Rio 2016, New Zealand rowers Hamish Bond and Eric Murray extended their remarkable unbeaten run in international regattas to 69 races over eight seasons, cementing their status as one of the greatest double acts the sport has ever seen.


A blow in Beijing The Dunedin-born Bond and the Hastings-born Murray, who is the senior of the two by nearly four years, first came together in the coxless four crew that won the world title in Munich in 2007. That NZ quartet, which also featured James Dallinger and Carl Meyer, brought an abrupt end to Great Britain’s domination of the event by winning seven of the eight international races on the programme that year. The New Zealand four went to Beijing 2008 as strong favourites for gold. Surprisingly, however, they missed out on a place in the final and eventually had to settle for first place in the B final, though Bond did have the consolation of becoming New Zealand’s 1,000th ever Olympian in China. The start of a wonderful storyIn response to that major disappointment, Bond and Murray decided to change to a new boat. “It had been in the back of my mind since Beijing,” said the younger member of the pair, “We’d trained in pairs while we were preparing for the four and we had done some fast times. I knew that the combination had potential. Eric was taking time away from the sport and looking at his options and I approached him and he decided it would be worth a crack. Thankfully the selectors, in their infinite wisdom, agreed.” The rest is history. The duo began their supremacy by winning the coxless pair world title in Poznan (POL) in 2009, a year that also saw them win the New Zealand Team of the Year award. They retained that world title on home water in Karapiro the following year, and again in 2011 in Bled (SLO), and won every World Cup event they contested in the lead-up to London 2012.Breaking records in LondonBond and Murray laid down the best possible marker on their first outing at the London Games, setting a new world record of 6:08.50 on the water at Eton Dorney to win the first heat by nearly ten seconds from French pair Germain Chardin and Dorian Mortelette. Two days later the Kiwis cruised to victory in their semi-final, crossing the line with a comfortable margin over Italy’s Niccolo Mornati and Lorenzo CarbonciniThe NZ duo lined up in Lane 6 in the final and made a fast start in their bid for gold, though they trailed their French rivals by three hundredths of a second at the 500m mark. From that point on, however, the red-hot favourites took control, hitting 38 strokes a minute to pull out a 1.5-second lead over Chardin and Mortelette after 1,000m.Gliding across the water at an average speed of 19.1 km/h, the uncatchable Kiwis passed the 1,500m marker more than five seconds clear of Great Britain’s George Nash and William Satch, who were battling it out with the French for silver, a duel Chardin and Mortelette eventually won by a nose. Ahead of them, Bond and Murray crossed the line in 6:16.65 to seal gold in emphatic fashion.“It was great when I first got back (to New Zealand) and one of the coolest things I got to do was the All Blacks (the national rugby team) hosting all of the Olympic medallists in Dunedin,” said Bond, recalling the days that followed their Olympic triumph. “They introduced us at half-time to a full crowd of 30,000. It was a surreal feeling to have 30,000 people applaud and give a standing ovation. I’d almost put it on a par with the medal ceremony in London.”Staying on topNamed members of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2013, Bond and Murray continued to sweep aside all before them in the coxless pair, cruising to a fourth world title in Chungju (KOR) that September, and then a fifth the following August in Amsterdam (NED), where they also won the non-Olympic coxed pair event with Caleb Shepherd. An inevitable sixth world crown then came their way in Aiguebelette (FRA) in September 2015.“We don’t go out to defend anything,” said Murray, explaining their philosophy. “That’s the way we’ve always worked, which has been successful for us. You’ve got to go out there and win every single race you’re competing in. For the other crews, they’ve never beaten us, so they’ve probably got doubts: ‘Are we going to beat them? Probably not, because nobody ever has’. And that’s what’s really been driving us for the last four years: it’s been going out to try and win another gold medal at the Olympics.”Ruthless in Rio After dominating the heats and the semi-final at Rio 2016, Bond and Murray made a typically low-key start to their title defence in the final, lying third at the 500m mark behind Lawrence Brittain and Shaun Keeling of South Africa, and Giovanni Abagnale and Marco Di Costanzo of Italy. Gradually stepping up the pace, the NZ pair edged into the lead by the halfway point, 1.30 seconds ahead of the Italians. It was then that the defending champions hit the accelerator, pulling away from the rest of the field to open up a five-second advantage with 500m to go, with Great Britain’s Alan Sinclair and Stewart Innes joining the Italians and the South Africans in the battle for silver and bronze. Maintaining their stroke and composure all the way to the line, Bond and Murray claimed a second consecutive gold in the event in a time of 6:59.71, 2.8 seconds clear of the fast-finishing Brittain and Keeling, with Abagnale and Di Costanzo coming in third, 4.81 seconds behind the winners. Their second Olympic win stretched the six-time world champions’ undefeated run to 69 international races spread over eight glorious seasons, a staggering sequence that has made them one of the greatest partnerships the sport of rowing has ever seen. Only too happy to live up to the huge expectations that weighed on them going into Rio 2016, Bond and Murray were elated to have extended their remarkable winning streak in such brilliant fashion.“There’s a lot of relief in there. The conditions were pretty tough,” said Murray. “If we have a good race and we don’t win, we just accept it, but we don’t want to let the New Zealand rowing team down,” added Bond. “We always have to apply ourselves, but we did the hardest work in the four years leading up to this race. That’s what staying unbeaten is all about: All we can do is live up to expectations, not exceed them.” What next?Bond and Murray decided to take a well-earned break in 2017, while leaving the door open to a return to the New Zealand team for Tokyo 2020. “We’ve done the lot in coxless,” said Murray in late 2016. “After London 2012 we won all the races that mattered, and we did it again in Rio. For Tokyo, we could go and do it all over again.“We’re always up for a challenge. The only unfinished business for New Zealand rowing is the eight. We just have to ask ourselves if we feel we can help them to do it or if they’d be better off without us.” Showing his ability to excel off the water as well as on it, Bond took third place in the national cycling time-trial championship in January 2017, an indication – if it were needed – of the remarkable athleticism that has helped Murray and him to reach the pinnacle of rowing and remain there.

Rio 2016 saw Great Britain’s Andy Murray become the first player to win back-to-back Olympic singles titles in tennis, a sport that featured on the programme between 1896 and 1924 and had demonstration status from 1968 to 1984 before making a full return to the Games at Seoul 1988. Victorious against Roger Federer in the London 2012 final, Murray, who was his country’s flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony in Rio, retained his title with a gruelling four-set victory over Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro. In outlasting his dogged opponent to win 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, the Scot wrote his name in the Olympic record books.


“Emotionally, it was tough. Physically, it was hard,” said a fatigued but elated Murray afterwards. “There were so many ups and downs in the match. We both had our chances and it was one of the toughest matches that I’ve played to win a big event, for sure. I’m just happy I came out on top. I’ve had some tough defeats in these last couple of years, losing Grand Slam finals. Obviously, I’ve also managed to win a few big tournaments, which says a lot about my game.”


One of the best returners on the tour, Murray has gradually honed his considerable skills over the years, improving every aspect of his game, not least his temperament, under the watchful eye of his various coaches. A talented footballer in his younger years, to the extent that he was scouted by Glasgow Rangers, he turned his back on the game for good at the age of 15, choosing instead to devote his energies entirely to tennis.


A long-awaited breakthrough


Murray began his long climb to the top in 2006 and won his maiden ATP Tour title at Queen’s three years later. Success on the Grand Slam stage would take a good deal longer to arrive. Beaten by Federer in the 2008 US Open final, he would lose again to the Swiss in the 2010 Australian Open and 2012 Wimbledon finals, setbacks that sandwiched defeat to Djokovic in the 2011 Australian Open final. The Olympics would provide the turning point of Murray’s career, however. Beaten in the first round at Beijing 2008, the Briton atoned with a commanding display on the grass of Wimbledon, the scene of his third Grand Slam final defeat to Federer just a few weeks earlier. Inspired by his home crowd, the Briton sealed a place in the Olympic final with a 7-5 7-5 semi-final win over number two seed Djokovic.


Waiting for him there was his Swiss nemesis, the then world No1. Undaunted, Murray broke serve in the sixth game of the first set and served it out in style. A rare Federer double fault sealed the second set for the home favourite, who then closed out an emphatic 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 victory by dropping only a solitary point on his serve in the third. At the age of 25 he had become Great Britain’s first Olympic gold medallist in the men’s singles since Josiah Ritchie at London 1908, an achievement he described as “the greatest moment of my life”.


Knocked out of the men’s doubles with his brother Jamie, Murray just missed out on a second London 2012 gold with Laura Robson in the mixed doubles, the British pair losing the final on a tie break to Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi of Belarus.


Hitting the heights


Murray followed up his ground-breaking Olympic triumph by winning his first Grand Slam crown a few weeks later, beating Djokovic in the US Open final. In doing so he became the first British player to win a major title since Fred Perry in 1936 and also gained membership to the so-called Big Four, along with Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic. At Wimbledon the following year he got the better of the Serb once more, beating him in straight sets in the final to give Great Britain a first home winner since Perry 77 years earlier. Then, in 2015, Murray almost single-handedly carried his country to Davis Cup glory for the first time in 79 years, winning all eight of his singles matches and all three of his doubles outings, with GB claiming the famous “salad bowl” with a 3-1 defeat of Belgium.


Murray began 2016 by losing a third Australian Open final, this time to Djokovic, who got the better of him again at Roland Garros, where the British player won through to his first French Open final. A second Wimbledon title came his way a few weeks later, however, with Murray defeating Canada’s Milos Raonic in straight sets. That win on home grass set the Briton up for his title defence at Rio 2016, where he achieved yet another career milestone.


“Getting to carry the flag at the Opening Ceremony was an amazing experience,” he said, looking back on his Rio adventure. “It’s a great honour to get the opportunity to do that. I found that quite emotional. After the day I did it, I sort of had to regroup and get my mind on the matches. A match like that [the final] as well, the build-up the last 10 days or so, it’s been very emotional. I’m just very happy to have got over the line.”


Murray went on to end 2016 on the highest of highs. On 5 November, at the age of 29 years, 5 months and 23 days, he reached the final of the Masters 1000 tournament in Paris and in the process became the 26th player to rise to No1 in the ATP Rankings and the first British player top them since their inception in 1973. In doing so, Murray ended Djokovic’s long reign as the world’s best, one that stretched back to July 2014. The two-time Olympic champion celebrated in style the following day, defeating the USA’s John Isner in the final to cement his newly won position at the pinnacle of men’s tennis.


Tokyo 2020 experience


Murray has struggled with injuries in recent years, even acknowledging in 2018 that a hip problem could end his career. However, after career-saving surgery, he returned to the tour and qualified for the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games


Ahead of Tokyo 2020, Murray wrote of his experiences at his three previous Games: ""The Olympics mean a huge amount to me and it’s a massive honour to be able to compete at a fourth Games in Tokyo. Leading Team GB at the opening ceremony in Rio was one of the highlights of my career and winning in 2012 on home ground was an incredible moment.""


Once he arrived in Japan, Murray chose to withdraw from the singles tournament and playing for a third straight gold medal to focus on his run in the doubles alongside partner Joe Salisbury. The pair reached the quarter-finals before being eliminated.

Three-time Olympic women’s doubles champions, Venus and Serena Williams have each won four golds at the Games. The elder of the two was also the first to complete the singles and doubles ‘double’, at Sydney 2000, a feat her sibling repeated 12 years later. In winning a fifth medal – mixed doubles silver – at Rio 2016, Venus became the most decorated tennis player in Olympic history since 1896.


Sister actOne of five siblings, Venus Williams was born in Lynwood, California, 15 months before her sister and future doubles partner, Serena. Their father Richard was determined that his daughters would be tennis champions and took on the role of coaching them himself from a very young age. Venus and Serena were both quick to develop their physical strength (Venus was already producing serves in excess of 160 km/h by the age of 10), winning numerous tournaments across the USA as they progressed through the age categories. Venus turned professional when she was just 14. Three years later, in 1997, she became the first unseeded player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam final, at the US Open, only to be outclassed by Switzerland’s Martina Hingis.First Olympic titlesIt was Serena who kickstarted the Williams sisters’ era of Grand Slam domination, claiming the US Open title in 1999. The following year, Venus won the first of her own Grand Slam titles, triumphing at Wimbledon and then the US Open, defeating fellow American Lindsay Davenport on both occasions. Straight after her victory in New York, she headed for Sydney, where she powered past Russia’s Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-4 to win Olympic gold in the women’s singles final. The following day she teamed up with Serena for the women’s doubles final, with the sisters taking just 49 minutes to dispatch Dutch pair Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans 6-1, 6-1. In the process, Venus became the first woman to win the singles and doubles at the same Games since Helen Wills Moody in 1924. It was the start of the Williams sisters’ longstanding love affair with the Olympic doubles tournament. Speaking after that first win, Venus said: “For me, this is almost bigger than singles. To have a victory like this with Serena, my sister, a member of my family and my best friend, doesn't happen often. It's very rare. Just to be able to play and win together at this level is really huge.” Winning together was something the sisters would go on to do on many occasions in the years that followed. Williams vs Williams In 2001, Venus and Serena became the first sisters to contest a major tournament final when they faced off at the US Open. On that occasion it was the elder sibling who came out on top. In February 2002, Venus was confirmed as world No1, going on to face, and lose against, her sister in a remarkable series of four consecutive Grand Slam finals (from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian). Meanwhile, Venus, whose career was later disrupted by a series of injuries, made Wimbledon her own, winning the event a total of five times. The last of those victories came against Serena in 2008, with the two then joining forces on Centre Court to land a record 14th Grand Slam doubles title.Olympic treble An injury to Serena in August 2004 forced the sisters to withdraw from the women’s doubles in Athens, though they were on top again in 2008 and 2012. In Beijing, they overcame Spain’s Anabel Medina and Virginia Ruano 6-2, 6-0, and on the Wimbledon grass four years later they swept aside Czech duo Andrea Hlavacova and Lucie Hradeck 6-4, 6-4, with Venus securing the gold with a sumptuous backhand volley. “Crazy,” said Serena, who had won the singles final the previous day. “I'm always copying her. I forgot that she did it in Sydney and I do it here. We're the same doubles team, we just split this to singles, so it's cool.”Silver lining in Rio Venus remained a fixture on the WTA Tour in the years that followed. Though major singles titles were no longer coming her way, she did win a sixth Wimbledon women’s doubles title with her sister in 2016, taking to 14 their unbeaten run in Grand Slam finals since 1999. Their proud record of winning every Olympic women’s doubles competition they entered ended at Rio 2016, where they lost 6-3, 6-4 in the first round to Czech pair Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova. Venus tumbled out of the singles at the same stage, beaten in three sets by Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens. She gave herself a chance of becoming the first tennis player – male or female – of all time to win five Olympic golds by reaching the mixed doubles final with Rajeev Ram. It was not to be, however, as their compatriots Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock edged them out 10-7 in the final set. That silver was nevertheless an historic one: it made Venus the most decorated of Olympic tennis player of them all.

The United States and Brazil have won gold in every men’s or women’s beach volleyball tournament. Few would have put money on Germany beating both countries to the top step of the podium in the competition at London 2012 ­­– but Julius Brink and Jonas Reckermann did just that.


They were rocking the sport’s two superpowers with a stunning three-set victory over Brazil in the final.


The powerful pairing pulled off their famous victory in front of 15,000 delirious spectators at Horse Guards Parade. It was a significant win not just for Germany, but also for European teams, so often in the shadow of their transatlantic rivals. 


In fact it was a breakthrough tournament for the continent, with Brink and Reckermann one of three European duos to reach the semi-finals. Latvia went on to take third place and the Netherlands finished fourth.


And though the German pair had an age advantage over Brazilian stars Alison Cerutti and Emanuel Rego, there was no taking away from their triumph in one of the Games’ most popular sports – staged with a dash of irreverent humour by organisers.


Reckermann said afterwards: ‘It’s unbelievable – they have been the best team for the last few years and Emanuel is a living legend, but we knew we had a chance.


“It’s great for European beach volleyball. It’s great that we were the ones who won the gold. I hope it will bring up our sport in Europe.”


Brink, 30, won gold at the 2006 European Beach Volleyball Championships in The Hague, Netherlands, and took part in the Olympic Games in 2008 before pairing up with Reckermann the following year. 


For his part Reckermann, 33, had represented Germany at the 2004 Games in Athens, where he finished in ninth place with partner Markus Dieckmann, and had also racked up two European Beach Volleyball Championship wins, in 2002 and 2004.


But as a team the Cologne pair has been unstoppable, winning four Fédération Internationale de Volleyball competitions – including three consecutive Grand Slams – and the German Masters of the CEV European Championship Tour. 


Since their now-legendary victory in London, the dynamic duo have become stars in their homeland – hardly surprising given that more than nine million Germans watched the final live on television.


A stunned Reckermann said: “I could not even imagine that such a fuss was possible in beach volleyball.”


Though they have committed to keeping their double act together until 2014, Brink and Reckermann are for now silent on whether they’ll be in Rio in 2016. But legions of new European fans attracted to the sport will surely be hoping for a rerun of the London final at the Copacabana Stadium.

Nicknamed “Six Feet of Sunshine”, Kerri Walsh-Jennings formed part of the greatest pairing beach volleyball has ever seen, teaming up with Misty May-Treanor to win three Olympic gold medals and three world titles and go unbeaten for a remarkable 112 games. On returning to the Olympic stage at Rio 2016 with a new partner, April Ross, she won bronze at the age of 37. 





An Olympic debut, indoors 


Born in California, Kerri Walsh was an exceptionally talented college volleyball player, helping Stanford University win the 1996 and 1997 NCAA titles and being named MVP in both finals, against Hawai’i and Penn State respectively. She was also only the second college volleyball player in history to feature in the All-American first-team four years in a row.


Walsh was only 22 when she made her Olympic debut, at Sydney 2000, with the USA volleyball team. Beaten in five sets by Russia in the semi-finals, the Americans finished out of the medals after losing to Brazil in the match for third place. Though Walsh had already begun suffering the shoulder problems that would dog her throughout her career, her ailment did lead her to improve her tactical understanding and reading of the game and enhance her sense of positioning. 





The greatest pairing of all time 


Also competing for the USA at Sydney 2000 was Misty May-Treanor, who partnered Holly McPeak in beach volleyball, with the pair ending the competition in fifth place. After the Games, May-Treanor invited Walsh to join her, setting the wheels in motion for what would become the most successful tandem in the history of women’s beach volleyball. 


May and Walsh began their long reign on the domestic and global scenes in 2001, going on to dominate proceedings on the U.S. professional tour and at the Olympics and FIVB World Championships. Unbeaten in 90 matches when they arrived at Athens 2004, the USA duo swept all before them at the Faliro Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre, winning every match in straight sets and crowning their majestic run by defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar 21-17, 21-11 in the final. 


World champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, May and Walsh were on a 101-match and 18-tournament winning streak when they began their Olympic title defence at Beijing 2008. After cruising through to the final, they beat China’s No1-ranked Tian Jia and Wang Jie in two sets to retain the gold. They eventually took that unbeaten run to 112 matches.


Threepeat at London 2012 


Walsh, who married fellow beach volleyball player Casey Jennings in 2005 and had two children in the years after Beijing, was back on the sand with May-Treanor in 2011, with the pair setting their sights on a third straight gold at London 2012. 


It duly came their way on the court on Horse Guards Parade, where the two Californians saw off April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in two sets in the final. May-Treanor promptly announced her retirement, having played her part in 21 consecutive wins at the Olympics since 2004, a run in which the fabled American pair lost just one set, against Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London. 


Five Games, four medals


Walsh-Jennings invited Ross to be her new playing partner, before giving birth to a third child in 2013. On returning to competitive action, she and Ross nailed down a place at Rio 2016, where she would go in search of a fourth Olympic title at her fifth Games, at the age of 38. 


The American pair made it to the semi-finals, where they went down 22-20, 21-18 to Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas de Freitas, the only defeat Walsh-Jennings ever suffered in her entire Olympic beach volleyball career. Atoning for that reverse, she and Ross then secured bronze with a three-set win over Brazil’s world-No1 pair Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes.


                                    “As an athlete, I swear this is the hardest match I’ve ever played in my life,” Walsh-Jennings said afterwards. “It was all perseverance.” The effort was worth it. In winning her fourth Olympic medal, the American became the most decorated beach volleyball player in the history of the Games.

American beach volleyball star Misty May‐Treanor enjoyed a record‐breaking career, which came to a glorious end with a third consecutive Olympic title at London 2012.


A golden swansong in London


After completing a two‐set victory over fellow USA duo April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the London 2012 final, Misty May‐Treanor and Kerri Walsh‐Jennings turned and fell into each other’s arms, overcome by the emotion of winning their third Olympic women’s beach volleyball title in a row. In doing so, they put together a 21‐match winning run, losing just a solitary set on the way, to Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London.


At the end of it all, May‐Treanor called time on her 13‐year career on the professional world beach volleyball circuit, during which she became one half of the most successful pair the sport has ever seen. “The first two gold medals it was more about volleyball,” she said after stepping down from the podium in London. “The friendship we had was there, but it was volleyball, volleyball, volleyball. This was so much more about the friendship, the togetherness, the journey – and volleyball was just a small part of it.”


Indoor beginnings


The daughter of Butch May, a member of the USA men’s volleyball team at Mexico City 1968, Misty May, as she then was, was introduced to the sport by her parents on the beach in Santa Monica, California. During her childhood years she met some of the greatest names in the sport, among them future triple Olympic champion Karch Kiraly, who sometimes baby‐sat for her.


May went on to become an outstanding indoor volleyball player herself, excelling at school and university and forming part of the Long Beach State 49ers side that recorded 36 consecutive wins in the 1998/99 NCAA Championship season, during which she set a new tournament record for service aces and was named the competition’s most outstanding player.


A record‐breaking partnership


After promptly falling out of love with the indoor game, May decided at the age of 22 to become a professional beach volleyball player. Teaming up with Holly McPeak, she competed in her first Olympics at Sydney 2000, where the pair eventually finished fifth. She then found a new partner in Kerri Walsh. Together they would dominate the domestic and global scene for years to come.


Arriving at Athens 2004 on the back of a 90‐match unbeaten run, the US twosome went on to win the competition without dropping a set, defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil 21‐17, 21‐11 in the gold‐medal match. FIVB world champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, they had gone 101 matches and 18 tournaments unbeaten by the time Beijing 2008 came around, and completed their Olympic title defence by seeing off No1‐ranked Chinese duo Tian Jia and Wang Jie.


Time‐out and a three‐peat


In between her first two Olympic triumphs, May married the baseball player Matt Treanor, while her partner Walsh took time out after Beijing to have two children with her husband, the volleyball player Casey Jennings. May‐Treanor then ruptured an Achilles tendon on the US TV show Dancing with the Stars, an injury that sidelined her for more than a year.


After failing to reach the heights with interim partner Nicole Branagh in 2010, May‐Treanor was reunited with Walsh‐Jennings the following year, with the pair setting their sights on an unprecedented third Olympic gold. After booking their place at London 2012 with a silver in the worlds in Rome that June, they duly achieved their golden goal, consolidating their place in the history of the sport and bowing out with a series of records that will take some beating.


Now a guest lecturer, brand spokesperson and prominent media figure, May‐Treanor fulfilled another long‐cherished dream in June 2014, giving birth to a daughter.

The most successful female track cyclist in the history of the UCI World Championships, Anna Meares is also Australia’s most decorated cycling Olympian, with six medals to her name. The only Australian athlete to have won individual medals at four consecutive Olympic Games, she rounded off her brilliant career with keirin bronze at Rio 2016. 


Starting out


The youngest of four children, Anna Meares grew up in Middlemount, Queensland (AUS), and played a number of sports, including karate, BMX, triathlon and swimming. Her interest in cycling was stirred at the age of 11, when she and her elder sister Kerrie watched Kathy Watt, Australia’s 1992 Olympic road race champion, compete at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. “We were most interested in track cycling and in the speed of the velodrome,” she explained.


Their father promptly found them a club. The only snag was that it was located 300km away, in Mackay. “He drove us in one weekend; we fell in love with the sport,” recalled Meares. “So for two years, mum and dad would pick Kerrie and me up from school on a Friday afternoon, drive the 300km for us to race Friday night and Sunday morning, before driving home in time for school on Monday morning.” The family then made the decision to move to the town of Rockhampton, which had its own velodrome, giving Anna and Kerrie the opportunity to practice daily.


A world record in Athens 


A 500m world junior champion in 2001, the up-and-coming Anna then won individual sprint bronze at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester (GBR), where Kerrie took gold in the 500m time trial. At the age of 19, Meares joined the Australian Institute of Sport in Adelaide, continuing her studies while enjoying great success in the international arena. 


After winning 500m time trial gold at the worlds in Melbourne in 2004, she went on to claim Olympic glory in Athens in the same event, posting a new world record of 33.952 and becoming the first female rider to dip under the 34-second mark. Having qualified with the fastest time in the sprint event, she made up for the disappointment of losing to Canada’s Lori-Ann Muenzer in the semi-final by beating Russia’s Svetlana Grankovskaya in the bronze medal race.


More medals


In 2007, the Australian claimed a second 500m world title in Palma (ESP). When her favourite event was removed from the Olympic programme, Meares chose to take part in the sprint at Beijing 2008, reaching the final, where she lost 2-0 to her British rival Victoria Pendleton.


Meares went on to win gold medals in every track cycling speed event (500m time trial, keirin, sprint and team sprint) at the three world championships held between 2009 and 2011, a feat unprecedented in the sport.


London glory 


The Australian faced Pendleton once more in the London 2012 sprint final. The British rider, who was keen to cap her career with a gold medal on home soil, was disqualified in the first race, with  the resilient Meares then winning the second in front of a vociferous crowd to claim the Olympic title.


“Racing in front of that crowd was something unique,” she said after the final. “The decibel measure that was taken was about 114 and 95 per cent of that was aimed towards Victoria. I was very nervous and I'm glad I dyed my hair before the competition because otherwise I would have gone grey!”


A record in 2015


Meares’ long-held dream of surpassing Félicia Ballanger’s World Championship gold medal total of 10 finally became reality in February 2015, when the 31-year-old Australian made it world title number 11 in the keirin in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (FRA). Her next goal was to add to her collection of Olympic medals at Rio 2016. 


Carrying the flag


The Opening Ceremony in Rio saw Meares become only the second cyclist to have the honour of carrying Australia’s flag, after Dunc Gray at Berlin 1936. Entering three events in total, the two-time Olympic champion made her first bid for a medal in the team sprint, where she and team-mate Stephanie Morton were just beaten to the bronze by Germany’s Kristina Vogel and Miriam Welte.





Six medals in four Games


Meares had higher hopes of success in the keirin the following day. Fifth in the event at London 2012, she went two better on this occasion, finishing a tyre-width behind Great Britain’s Rebecca James, with the gold going to Elis Ligtlee of the Netherlands. “Unfortunately I stepped into the bend three wide coming into the finish line and that cost me a little bit of speed,” said the Australian speedster afterwards. “But at the same time I had to go, so I'm really pleased. This was the main motivating force to keep riding from London, to better my result from this event.” 


That bronze, her sixth Olympic medal, made her Australia’s most decorated cycling Olympian and the first athlete from the country to win individual medals at four consecutive Games. “All my goals were for this event [the keirin], so tomorrow I'm just going to go out there and have fun,” she said ahead of her sprint title defence, which would end in the second round, with Meares eventually taking tenth place in the competition. 


                                    Two months later, on 16 October 2016, the greatest Australian cyclist of them all announced her retirement from the sport at the age of 33, stating: “I didn't get a fairy tale ending [to these Olympics] but I had a good ending.”

It would take a long, long time to list all of André Lange’s achievements, all those titles, wins and gold medals. To mention only the best, André Lange is a four-time Olympic champion, eight-time world champion and eight-time European champion, with 36 World Cup wins and 5 general ranking victories.


Langen and Lange


In 1998, Lange was still too young to compete at the Games in Nagano, so he won the junior World Championships hands down instead. The top bobsledder at the time was Germany’s Christoph Langen, the reigning Olympic champion. Four years later in Salt Lake City, the two men shared top billing and the gold medals: Langen driving the two-man bob and Lange driving the second German four-man bob.


In 2006, André Lange competed in the two events on the programme of the Games in Turin. Of the eight runs with his team, he won five, also finishing second twice and fourth once. For André and his partners, including Kevin Kuske, his loyal pusher since the start, recognition had arrived: they were two-time Olympic champions.


Silver for one-hundredth; gold at the end


In Vancouver in 2010, André Lange was still one of the bobsleigh favourites. In tribute to his prestigious career, he was chosen as his team’s flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony. Beaten by the Americans in the four-man bob, Lange and his partners took the silver medal by one-hundredth of a second in the final run, beating the Canadians. In the two-man bob, André made good use of his experience. Second in the first run, he won the next three and his fourth Olympic title. Until he and his partner Kuske came along, nobody before had ever managed to win four gold medals in bobsleigh. André Lange can take a well-deserved retirement.

Kaillie Humphries is one of bobsleigh's greats, having won the two-woman race at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014, and bronze at PyeongChang 2018 while competing for Canada. In 2019, the Calgary-born driver switched allegiance to the USA, and won two-woman gold at the 2020 World Championships. Two more World Championships golds were added in 2021, including the monobob which will made its Olympic debut at Beijing 2022.


Disappointment in Turin


Kaillie Humphries began her international career as a brakewoman, earning a place in the Canadian team for Turin 2006. After parading with the rest of the delegation at the Opening Ceremony, her dreams of competing were dashed when she was informed by team management that she would not be taking part. “I just started crying and went to my room. I thought, ‘Do I stay here and gain experience or do I go home?’” she said. “I decided to stay and support my team by cheering them on. I thought I couldn’t let that be my Olympic experience, so that was when I made the decision to become a bobsleigh pilot.”


 Victory in Vancouver


Humphries began training with brakewoman Heather Moyse, and it was not long before impressive results started to come their way in the World Cup. After winning their first race at Altenberg in December 2009, they headed to Vancouver 2010 ranked second in the world. On board Canada 1, Humphries and Moyse swept the rest of the field aside, beating the Whistler Sliding Centre start and track records in each of the first three runs to claim a convincing gold. In becoming the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic bobsleigh title and the first Canadian to win gold in a two-man event, Humphries also secured what was only her country’s second ever bobsleigh crown, 46 years on from Peter Kirby, Doug Anakin and John and Vic Emery’s win in the four-man event at Innsbruck.


Different partners, same result


The Calgary pilot went on to become the world No. 1, a status she would retain with various partners. After Moyse moved on, Humphries won the 2011-12 World Cup title with Emily Baadsvik, and then teamed up with Jennifer Ciochetti to land the world title in Lake Placid in February 2012. The following season, this time partnered by Chelsea Valois, she scored an incredible six consecutive World Cup wins, a feat she capped by retaining her world title in St Moritz in January 2013.


A landmark achievement


In the meantime, Humphries also represented her country at the 2010 Women’s Rugby World Cup and competed in international track cycling events before undergoing hip surgery in 2012. She was reunited with Moyse at the start of the 2013-14 season, with the pair gradually finding their form before delivering a stunning performance at Sochi 2014. Trailing the US pair Elana Meyers and Lauryn Williams going into the fourth and final run, the Canadians produced a scintillating descent to pip their rivals by 0.10 seconds and become the first duo ever to retain the Olympic two-woman title.


“It’s hard to express how I feel,” Humphries later said. “There have been a lot of sacrifices, not only on my part but by my friends and my family. And Heather has come back on board after having had an operation. This is something that we’ve done together and it’s a fantastic feeling. After the third run I knew that if we did our job we’d make it to the top.”


More World Cup wins


By the end of the 2013/14 season, Humphries had won her second two-woman World Cup title. After finishing second to Elana Meyers-Taylor the following year, she won the World Cup for a third time in 2015/16 before taking second place again, this time behind the USA’s Jamie Greubel Poser.


A vociferous advocate of the four-woman bobsleigh, Humphries drove a mixed bob and then formed part of an all-woman bob that competed against all-male crews in the IBSF World Cup in 2016, part of her campaign to have the four-woman included on the Olympic programme.


Prior to appearing at her fourth Winter Games, Humphries won the two-woman World Cup crown for a fourth time, triumphing in four of the eight events, with Melissa Lotholz behind her in the first part of the season and Phylicia George taking over brakewoman duties in the second. And it was with George that Humphries would go for Olympic gold again at PyeongChang 2018.


A bronze in Pyeongchang 


The Canadian duo lay a lowly fifth after the first two runs at the Alpensia Sliding Centre, with Germany’s Mariana Jamanka and Lisa Buckwitz fighting it out with Meyers-Taylor and Lauren Gibbs of the USA for first place.


By the end of the third run Humphries and George had climbed up to third, where they would remain after the fourth, 0.44 seconds behind Jamanka and Buckwitz, who beat Meyers-Taylor and Gibbs to the gold by 0.07 seconds.


“This is probably my most emotional medal because of all the hard work we’ve put in, the investment we’ve put in and the importance of it,” said Humphries after becoming a three-time Olympic medallist. “I’m so happy right now. It’s a great honour to take part in the Olympic Games and represent Canada.”


Switching to the USA 


In 2019, Bobsleigh Canada ranted Humphries' request to be released from their programme, in order to join the United States. The switch seemed to give her a boost, resulting in the two-woman 2020 World Championships title. The good form continued into the 20201 world champs, where she partnered former hurdler Lolo Jones to gold in the two-woman, before taking gold in the monobob - which made its debut at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

Born October 10, 1984 American Elana Meyers Taylor is the definition of bobsleigh royalty.


At Beijing 2022 the California native confirmed her status as such when, age 37, she won a silver in the women's inaugural monobob competition and bronze in the two-person bobsleigh with brakewoman Sylvia Hoffman to become the most decorated Black athlete in the history of the Winter Olympics.


With her two medals from the Chinese capital the American now sits on a total of five Olympic medals - three silver and two bronze - meaning that in five races, at four Olympics, she has never finished off the podium.


Her success in the Chinese capital comes off the back of a career where Meyers Taylor has achieved almost everything her sport has to offer.


It all started at the 2009 World Championships, where she piloted to silver in the two-woman event alongside Shauna Rohbock in Lake Placid, USA.


That performance helped Meyers Taylor get selected for the USA at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, where she finished with a bronze medal. Another world silver followed at the 2013 world champs in St. Moritz, Switzerland, alongside brakewoman Katie Eberling.


The 2014 season turned out to be a significant turning point for Meyers Taylor on several levels.


Firstly, the American partnered up with Lauryn Williams to win Olympic silver at Sochi 2014. It was also the season where the IBSF announced it would allow mix-gender crews to compete in 4-person bobsleigh, and on 8 November, she piloted a four-person crew to third place in the US trials, securing a place to compete for the US national team with only having four day of experience in a four-person sled.


On November 15, 2014, Meyers Taylor partnered her husband and fellow bobsleigh athlete Nic Taylor to become the first women (alongside Kaillie Humphries) to compete with and against men in an international four-person bobsleigh competition, in the season-opening North American Cup race in Park City, Utah.


Another huge first saw Meyers Taylor secure her - and the United States' - first two-woman world title in 2015 at Winterberg, Germany, alongside pusher Cherrelle Garrett. It was a feat she would go on to repeat at the 2017 Worlds, where she claimed gold again this time, with Kehri Jones.


Meyers Taylor then went on to win her third Olympic medal at the PyeongChang 2018 Games, this time with Lauren Gibbs as brakewoman. Little did she know then, that with the inclusion of the monobob event - something she and Humphries had passionately been advocating for for years - that by the next Olympic cycle would become a sporting legend.


Taylor's talents also extend beyond the snow. She attended George Washington University on a softball scholarship, and in 2014 represented the USA women's rugby sevens team at the China Women's Sevens. She has also served as president of the Women's Sports Foundation, empowering future female athletes.

Wolfgang and Andréas Linger started practising luge on the Igls Olympic track, used for the Innsbruck Games in 1964 and 1976. These two brothers, who are not twins, started out in the one-man events. It was only five years later that they teamed up. At the 2002 Games, the Linger brothers became part of the world luge elite, but did not do enough to win any titles. After two good races, they finished sixth at the Salt Lake City Games.


The Cesana track - cursed, then blessed


The following year was a revelation – firstly coming fourth in the World Cup, they went on to dominate all their opponents to win the 2003 World Championship title on the Sigulda track in Latvia. But everything looked as if it was coming to an end in 2005 at Cesana in Italy, on the future Olympic track, where they came off in the last bend but one.


Wolfgang had a higher price to pay, fracturing his ankle and fibula. But his passion for luge was too great. He rejoined the circuit the following year with his brother. The two brothers had another rendezvous with Cesana for the Turin Olympic Games in 2006. This time, they did not come off the track; they won the first race and finished second in the next one. It was a victory for the Austrian brothers – they were Olympic champions!


Rising to the major challenges


Between 2006 and 2010, the Linger brothers were still near the top, but did not win any major victories. Arriving in Vancouver, they knew that it was not going to be easy and that their opponents were very strong. The Latvians, Germans, Italians and Americans were bound to be formidable competitors.


On 17 February, the two heats of the doubles event were held. From the first intermediate times, the two Austrians were in the lead. They passed the finish line with an average time of 135 kmh. The Latvian Sic brothers came in eight-hundredths of a second behind then, followed by the German pair 23-hundredths of a second later. There was one heat left to race, and the pressure was on Wolfgang and Andréas. They made a perfect start and did not commit a single error on the whole run. Although slower than in the first heat, they were still in the lead in this second round. There was no doubt that they were the champions today, winning their second gold medal. They were the first lugers to retain their Olympic title in this event since the East Germans, Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn, in 1976 and 1980.

Before the Torino Games the IOC suspended her for five days for an increased hemoglobin level, so she could not start in her favorite race, the pursuit. Nevertheless she won a silver medal in the relay a few days later.

Over the course of three appearances at the Olympic Winter Games, Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla has become her country’s most successful female cross-country skier of all time. Curiously, she has won two of her three golds and one of her six silvers on the very same day, 15 February, at four-year intervals.


Red letter day


15 February has a talismanic significance in the life of Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla. It was on that very day in 2010 that she made her Olympic debut, in the 10km freestyle in Vancouver. Starting 31st, she simply blew the rest of the field away, leading at every split and finishing a full 6.6 seconds clear of the defending champion, Kristina Smigun-Vaehi of Estonia, and more than 15 seconds ahead of Norway’s Marit Bjørgen.


Kalla’s victory opened Sweden’s gold medal account at Vancouver and she became the country’s first individual cross-country skiing champion at the Winter Games since Grenoble 1968, when Toini Gustafsson collected two golds.


Four years to the day later, 26-year-old Kalla found herself anchoring for Sweden in the 4x5km relay at Sochi, in a team that also featured Ida Ingemarsdotter, Emma Wiken and Anna Haag. By the time she took over from Haag, Kalla had a 27-second deficit to make up on Finland and Germany, with Krista Lahteenmaki and Denise Hermann fighting it out for the lead on the last leg.


Finding some searing pace, Kalla caught up with the two frontrunners at the top of the last climb and then burst clear to be embraced by her ecstatic team-mates at the finish line. In tribute to her stunning performance, Pajala Airport – situated in her native province of Norrbotten – changed its name to Kalla International Airport that same day.


Five days after claiming the first gold of PyeongChang 2018 with a majestic display in the 15km skiathlon, Kalla continued her happy knack of winning Olympic medals on 15 February. On this occasion she picked up a silver in the 10km freestyle, finishing 20 seconds behind Norway’s Ragnhild Haga and a little over 10 seconds clear of joint bronze medallists Bjørgen and Krista Parmakoski of Finland. In doing so, Kalla became the first skier to win three consecutive medals in the event.


Nine olympic medals


Hailing from the northern village of Tarendö, where she took up her sport at the age of seven, Kalla had taken her haul of Olympic medals to nine by the time she left the Republic of Korea (three golds and six silvers). As well as joining fellow cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg as her country’s most decorated Winter Olympian, Kalla is also Sweden’s most successful female Olympian of all time.


Aside from the two golds she won at her first two Olympic Games, Kalla claimed three silvers: in the team sprint with Anna Haag at Vancouver 2010, and the 15km skiathlon and 10km classical at Sochi 2014. Her two other visits to the second step of the podium came in PyeongChang, alongside Anna Haag, Ebba Andersson and Stina Nilsson in the 4x5km, and with Nilsson again in a thrilling team sprint won by the USA.


Sweden’s undisputed number one


“I got the hang of cross-country skiing straightaway,” said Kalla, discussing her love for her sport. “The lifestyle of a skier and the fact you have to train twice a day is no sacrifice for me. It’s something I love, something I look for, every day and all year round.”


After winning the world junior skiathlon title in Kranj (SLO) in February 2006, Kalla quickly established herself as Sweden’s leading cross-country skier. Her many triumphs outside the Olympic arena include an FIS Tour de Ski crown in 2008, the Nordic Opening in 2018, a world team spring crown with Ida Ingemarsdotter in Oslo in 2011, and a world 10km freestyle gold won on home snow in Falun in 2015.


Her total of 12 World Championship medals includes four consecutive 4x5km relay silvers between 2011 and 2017. In the World Cup, meanwhile, she has amassed no fewer than 55 individual podium finishes – 11 of them wins, as of the end of the 2017/18 season – and 11 top-three finishes in team events.


“I’m living my dream by having the privilege of taking part in sport full time,” said the Swedish legend, who at the age of 30 has yet to contemplate the end of her career and may yet make a fourth Olympic appearance at Beijing 2022.

A keen sportsman, Zac Purchase started rowing in 1997 while at King’s College, Worcester, and came to prominence when he was World Under-23 lightweight single sculls champion in 2005. By the end of the year he had added a silver medal in the senior World Championships and established himself as an up-and-coming talent. This talent was revealed conclusively in front of a home crowd at the 2006 World Championships when he rowed away from his rivals to record an easy victory. Since the lightweight single sculls is not an Olympic event British coaches had to search for someone to partner Purchase when to he moved to the doubles and found him in the form of Mark Hunter. The pair were never off the podium in their first season together and won a bronze at their first World Championships in 2007 but this was nothing compared to 2008. Purchase and Hunter won all three races of the World Cup series to arrive at the Olympics as overwhelming favourites and backed this up in Beijing to win Olympic gold. After a year away from the sport the pair returned in 2010 and has won both the 2010 and 2011 World Championships. They were under pressure to win their second Olympic gold medal in 2012 and just when they looked to have victory in sight, saw it snatched away from them on the line by the winning Danish pair. The month after the Olympics, Purchase married his long-time girlfriend, and fellow rower, Felicity “Fliss” Hill in St. Paul’s Cathedral. He then took 18 months away from the sport before returning in 2014 with the intention of joining the heavyweight squad but that proved fruitless and he announced his retirement soon afterwards. An excellent saxophonist, Purchase performed live on television at the 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards ceremony.

From a less privileged background than the majority of British rowers, Mark Hunter’s early life was centered around the river Thames. He learnt to row on the river as a member of the Poplar Blackwall & District Rowing Club and at 16 was apprenticed to be a Thames waterman with the intent on pursuing a career ferrying passengers along the river. After being a regular member of the national junior and under-23 programmes he progressed to the senior team in 2001, dropping into the lightweight category in the process. He was a member of the lightweight eight that reached the final of the 2001 World Championships but thereafter switched to the four, an Olympic class, in preparation for the Athens Olympics. The crew had a modicum of success on the road to Athens but had to be content with a victory in the C final and a lowly 13th place overall at the 2004 Games. In 2007 he was chosen to partner reigning world lightweight single sculls champion Zac Purchase in a double with the intent of contesting the 2008 Olympics. The pairing met with immediate success and were bronze medallists at their first World Championship together. Hunter and Purchase then maintained a perfect record throughout the 2008 season and won every race they contested up to and including the Olympic final. He then spent a year as an assistant coach at UCLA in California before returning to action in 2010. The duo won two further world titles in 2010 and 2011, when Mark was the British Olympic Association’s Olympic athlete of the year for rowing. Hunter and Purchase looked like retaining their Olympic title in 2012 and had victory in their sights until it was snatched form them in the final stages of a dramatic race by 6/10ths of a second. It was Hunter’s last major competition because he announced his retirement at Henley on the opening day of the 2013 Regatta, when he was also elected as a Henley steward. In February 2014 he was made the programme director at London Youth Rowing


After qualifying as a Waterman & Lighterman on the River Thames in 2002, Hunter became a Freeman of the Thames and as an apprentice in 2000, teamed up with John Dwan to win the commemorative Millennium Coat and Badge special double sculls race. Hunter is a keen all-round sportsman and likes football, cycling, badminton and swimming, and is a life-long supporter of West Ham United Football Club.

A golden generationWith 37 medals – 19 of them gold – Romania is among the most successful ever nations in the Olympic rowing events. That success is due in very large measure to four exceptional female rowers:  Elisabeta Lipa, Doina Ignat, Viorica Susanu and Georgeta Andrunache (nee Damian). This quartet dominated their events in the late 1990s and throughout the first decade of the new millennium. Andrunache, the youngest of the four, competed in four editions of the Games between Sydney in 2000 and London 2012, winning five gold medals in the eights and the coxless pairs; together with Lipa, she holds the joint record for the most Olympic titles won by an oarswoman.


Triumph in Sydney


On 23 September 2000 in Penrith, which was the centre for the rowing, kayak and canoe events in Sydney, Damian and Ignat found themselves up against reigning Olympic champions Missy Ryan and Karen Kraft in the final of the women’s coxless pairs. However, the American duo were no match for the Romanians who powered across the line 1.5 seconds ahead of them to claim gold.


Golden hat-trick in the pairs


Damian went on to form a partnership with Viorica Susanu, and together they set a new 2000m world record at the 2002 World Championships with a time of 6.53.80. The duo carried that form into the Olympic Games in Athens two years later. In the coxless pairs final on 14 August 2004 in Schinias, they launched a powerful break at the halfway mark to which the pursuing British, Belarusian, Canadian and German crews had no answer, and the Romanian duo cruised over the line for a clear victory. Damian and Susanu were back to defend their title in Beijing, and on 16 August 2008 achieved another impressive victory by a margin of almost two seconds, this time over China’s Wu You et Gao Yulan. Damian thus joined that elite club of Olympians who have won gold in the same event at three successive editions of the Games. 


Two golds in the eights


Damian was also part of the Romanian eight that won successive World Championship titles in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and was drafted into the crew at Sydney 2000 that successfully defended the Olympic title won by Romania four years earlier in Atlanta, before she was on the team. Ast Athens 2004, they defended their gold in the eights yet again, a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact that Damian and Susanu had only 24 hours to recover after their victory in the coxless pairs. Finally, at Beijing 2008, Damian and her coxless pairs partner were part of the octet that took bronze behind the USA and the Netherlands. 


London swansong


After 20 years competing at the top level, Damian, who is married to fellow rower Valeriu, decided to lay down her oars after Beijing, and took time out to have a second child. However, she was back ahead of London 2012, where she made a bid to win a third gold in the coxless pairs with Susanu. The pair reached the final but could only manage fifth place, at which point she called time on her career for the second and last time.

Romania’s Viorica Susanu competed in four editions of the Games, in both the coxless pairs and in the eights, winning five medals, three of them gold.


A golden generation


Born on the banks of the Danube, in the town of Galatj, Viorica Susanu was part of a golden generation for Romanian women’s rowing. A member of the eight that won consecutive World Championships in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and claimed Olympic gold at Sydney 2000, she subsequently went on to enjoy similar success in the coxless pairs, rowing with Georgeta Andrunache. During the final of the 2002 World Championships in Seville, the duo set a new world record of 6:53.80 as they finished over four seconds ahead of Canadian pair Jacqui Cook and Karen Clark.


Unbeatable in Athens


At the Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre at Athens 2004, Susanu and her Romanian oarswomen were at the peak of their powers. In the final of the coxless pairs on 21 August, she and Andranuche were untouchable. Leading from the start, by the halfway point they had established a gap of over two seconds, which they maintained into the finish. The following day, Susanu won her third Olympic gold in a Romanian eight that was every bit as dominant, again winning by over two seconds ahead of the American and Dutch boats in second and third.


Mixed fortunes in Beijing


In the final of the coxless pairs on 16 August 2008 at the Olympic rowing park in Shunyi, Andrunache and Susanu were once again in imperious form as they completed the defence of the title, leaving Chinese pair Wu You and Gao Yulan and Yuliya Bichyk and Natalia Helakh of Belarus to battle it out for the other podium spots. Twenty four hours  later, they were back in action in the final of the eights, but this time found themselves out-rowed by the USA crew, and then pipped at the finish line by the Dutch boat, to finish third.


Final fling in London


By the time London 2012 came around, Susanu and Andrunache were 36 and 35 respectively, and both now mothers. Despite four years away from competition, they finished fifth in the coxless pairs final, at which point they announced their retirement. Asked to name her favourite race during 10 years at the top, Susanu replied: “They are all equally magnificent if they end in a gold medal.” With two European titles, five world titles and four Olympic golds, Susanu enjoyed a career that was full of magnificent moments.

Elise Laverick originally planned to be a professional musician and studied at the famed Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. She is highly skilled at both violin and double bass. Encouraged by her mother, a former international rower, she began to row at the age of 17.


By 1997 she had developed enough to become part of the national eight and was a bronze medallist with that crew at her first appearance in a world championship. She regularly switched boat classes until 2004 when she formed a partnership with [Sarah Winckless] in the double sculls. The highlight of this partnership came at the Olympic Games where they overhauled a Chines pair in the closing stages to win a bronze medal. A few weeks later she suffered a setback whilst riding her bicycle in London. She suffered a broken hip, fractured hand and facial damage when she was knocked off her bicycle by a hit-and-run driver.  After several operations she returned to rowing six months later.


Eighteen months before the Athens Olympics she formed a new partnership with Anna Bebington which gave Laverick the second world medal of her career, another bronze, at the championships in Germany. At the 2008 Olympics the pairing figured in one of the closest races of the regatta when they finished third but less than a quarter of a second behind the New Zealand champions. She retired after the Games and began training to be a solicitor.

She earned four of her five gold medals together with her namesake, Anastasiya Yermakova, winning the duet competition at the 2004 and 2008 Games, while also joining the victorious Russian team on both occasions. Davydova won her fifth Olympic gold in the team event at the 2012 London Olympics. She won 13 gold medals at the World Championships, winning the team in 2001 and 2003; the duet in 2003 and 2005; team free routine in 2009 and 2011; team technical routine in 2011; the duet technical routine in 2007 and 2009; and the duet free routine in 2007. She also added a silver medal in duet at the 2001 Worlds.


Davydova studied at the Moskva Institute of Economics, Politics, and Law, and later coached youth synchro swimming. She became director of the Olympic Synchronized Swimming Center, and a vice-president of the Russian Olympic Committee. She was made a Cavalier of three Russian State Orders, and was chairman of the Council of Assistance to the Russian Olympic Committee.

Guo Jingjing was the fourth diver to win four Olympic gold medals (following Fu Mingxia, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick) and at her retirement, was the female diver with the most Olympic medals (trailing only Dmitry Sautin among men). Uniquely, Guo won her medals on the springboard (3 m) only, while the others also medaled in the platform (10 m). After winning two silver medals in the 2000 Games – together with Fu in the synchronized springboard – Guo doubled in the springboard and synchronized springboard at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, teaming up with Wu Minxia for the synchronized events on both occasions. At World Championships, she displayed a similar superiority. Between 2001 and 2009, she won five consecutive titles in both springboard events.

The winner of seven Olympic medals (five of them gold) and 14 World Championship medals (eight of them gold), China’s Wu Minxia is the most decorated female athlete in the history of diving. As well as collecting four consecutive Olympic 3m synchronised springboard titles between Athens 2004 and Rio 2016 with three different partners, she also won the 3m individual springboard gold at London 2012. 


The quest for individual gold


Wu Minxia’s long and hugely successful Olympic career began at Athens 2004. Partnering Guo Jingjing, she won gold in the 3m women’s synchronised springboard event, a title the duo retained at Beijing 2008, where Guo added another individual 3m springboard title to go with the one she had pocketed in the Greek capital four years earlier.Spotted at a very early age but hampered on her rise to the top by a string of injuries, Wu grew accustomed to being in Guo’s shadow. However, she never gave up hope of fulfilling the dream she had pursued since her childhood, when she would watch on TV as China’s divers soared to success on the Olympic stage, resolving to follow the trail they blazed.After taking individual 3m springboard silver behind Guo in Athens and collecting the bronze in Beijing, when Russia’s Yuliya Pakhalina split the Chinese duo, the ambitious Wu was determined to kick on and finally make that dream a reality.


A long-awaited world title


The turning point in her career came in 2011, a year that began with Guo announcing her retirement after amassing six Olympic medals, four of them gold, a record unrivalled at the time. Together Guo and Wu had also won four 3m synchronised springboard world titles (in 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009), and Wu would win another in Shanghai in 2011 with new partner He Zi. As a sign of things to come, Wu also claimed her one and only world 3m individual title that year, finishing ahead of He in a Chinese one-two.


Coronation in London 


There would be identical outcomes at London 2012, where Wu and He eased to synchronised springboard gold, top-scoring with each of their five dives to rack up a total of 346.20 points and win by a distance from USA’s Kelci Bryant and Abigail Johnston, and the Canadian duo of Jennifer Abel and Emilie Heymans. It was Wu’s third consecutive Olympic gold in the event. Held over three days, Wu dominating proceedings in the preliminary round of the individual 3m springboard competition  The 26-year-old was out in front again in the following day’s semi-finals, and then closed out the competition a day later with five precise dives to win what would be her first and last individual Olympic gold. The only competitor to score in excess of 85 marks – for her third and fifth dives – and to exceed 400 points in total, Wu was a comfortable winner ahead of team-mate He and Mexico’s Laura Sanchez. “I think we all have a dream, and I chose diving, with my aim being to make a difference,” she said at the time. “I never gave up on that dream, though I haven’t achieved this on my own. So many people have supported me, from my family and my coach, to a whole lot of other people behind the scenes.” In winning her sixth Olympic medal, Wu joined the great Guo at the pinnacle of women’s diving, while FINA named her Athlete of the Year in the female diving category in both 2011 and 2012. 


A new partner, more success 


Wu then joined forces with Shi Tingmao in the 3m synchro event, with the pair taking the world title in Barcelona (ESP) in 2013 and retaining it in Kazan (RUS) two years later. In the process, Wu became the first diver in history to win seven world golds in the event, with three different partners. “I’m getting older and it takes longer for me to recover now,” she said after her Kazan triumph. “I need to be efficient when I train and try to avoid picking up injuries. The synchronised was my only event here, and it’s always difficult to win the gold.” 


A matchless record


Wu came close to missing out on Rio 2016 after suffering a leg injury two months before the Games. She made the trip but sat out the individual competition, looking on as her current synchro partner Shi won by a distance from her former partner He. One week later, Wu was back in action alongside Shi to win her fourth consecutive synchronised gold from Italy’s Tania Gagnotto and Francesca Dallapé and Australia’s Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith. In climbing to the top of another Olympic podium, Wu joined her compatriot Chen Ruolin – who won a third consecutive 10m synchro title in Rio – on five diving golds, one more than American great Greg Louganis and her “big sister” Guo. Wu holds the distinctions, however, of being the most decorated Olympic diver in history with seven medals and the oldest woman to win Olympic gold in the sport.


Bowing out


On 22 December 2016, Wu announced her retirement from competitive diving at the age of 31. “Reluctantly, it’s time to call it a day,” she said live on Chinese TV. “The story of Chinese diving didn’t start with me and it won’t end with me. I am really sorry, but my physical condition does not allow me to continue training. I’ve always feared this day coming.” Though maybe not the first or the last great Chinese diver to grace the boards, Wu will no doubt remain the most successful for many years to come.

Iain Percy learnt to sail at the age of four and was only seventeen when he made his début at the Laser Class European Championships. He campaigned in the Laser Class and finished fifth in the 1996 World championships but missed selection for the 1996 Olympic Games. A switch to the Finn Class followed and he went on to win the European Championship in 1998. Percy spent many months training and competing off Sydney in the years preceding the 2000 Olympics and it paid off handsomely when he won the Olympic title so comfortably that he did not even have to compete in the final race of the series. He swapped classes again in 2001 to the two-man Star boat but, although he and partner Steve Mitchell were world champions in 2002, they could not translate that success to the Athens Games. Percy then took a year away from Olympic class sailing to become helm of the Italian-owned America’s Cup challenger +39 Challenge, but they finished way down the list of qualifiers in the Luis Vutton Challenge Series and failed to qualify. He returned to Star class racing and a year before the Beijing Games teamed up with lifelong friend Andrew Simpson. Initial results were below par but at the 2008 Olympics they won the gold medal with their performance in the final race. They added the 2010 World Championship gold to their medal collection and remain one of the world’s top crews. The pair joined the crew of the British America’s Cup challenger, Team Origin, under the helm of Ben Ainslie, but the team announced it was abandoning its challenge for the 2013 Cup. The Percy-Simpson partnership was unbreakable and at the London 2012 Olympics they won the silver medal. It was Iain’s third Olympic medal as he became only the third Briton after Rodney Pattisson and Ben Ainslie to win three Olympic sailing medals.


After the 2012 Olympics Iain and Andrew joined the Artemis Racing America’s Cup team, but that is when the Percy-Simpson partnership was sadly brought to an abrupt end following a tragic accident whilst training in San Francisco Bay, in which Andrew Simpson drowned. The team continued, and under Iain’s guidance they reached the semi-final of the Luis Vutton Cup, only to lose to the Italian challenger.

Andrew Simpson, also known as Bart Simpson after the popular cartoon character, was known as one of the world’s best sailors in the Laser and Finn classes but for two Olympics running his role was limited to that of training partner to two men, Iain Percy in 2000 and Ben Ainslie in 2004, who both became Olympic champion. In 2008, after both men had met with mixed results in other boats, he teamed up with Iain Percy to campaign for Olympic selection in the Star class. The two men had been close friends since boyhood but they struggled in their early events and placed 52nd at the World Championships in 2008. By Beijing the combination clicked together and they won the Olympic title in a desperately close competition against the Swedish duo. The pair continued their successful ways by winning a silver medal at the 2009 European Championships and a gold medal at the World Championships in 2010. Their medal-winning streak was broken in 2011 when Percy suffered a back injury that led to their withdrawal from the World Championships. The duo narrowly failed to defend their Olympic title on home waters at Weymouth in 2012 when they lost out on gold after a final race duel with the Brazilian crew wrecked both teams chances and let Sweden take the championship. Following the London Games Simpson joined the crew of the Swedish America’s Cup challenge. Whilst training in San Francisco Bay in May 2013 he became trapped under the boat after a capsize and could not be revived by paramedics after spending ten minutes underwater.


In memory of his friend, Iain Percy founded the Andrew Simpson Sailing Foundation in 2013, with the aim of helping sailors at the grass roots level of the sport, and also to provide opportunities to deserving children who would otherwise not get the opportunity to enjoy the thrill of sailing,

Robert Scheidt has collected medals at each of the five editions of the Olympic Games in which he has competed, a haul that makes him the joint highest medal winner in the history of Olympic sailing along with compatriot Torben Grael and Great Britain’s Ben Ainslie


From Optimist to Laser


Born in Sao Paulo, Robert Scheidt has been winning races since he was a child, becoming South American champion in the Optimist class at the age of only 11. A gifted tennis player, he nevertheless decided to devote all his energies to sailing in 1986, a year in which he was selected to represent Brazil at the Optimist World Championship. After switching to Snipe, Scheidt then moved into the Olympic sailing class Laser, taking the 1991 junior world title in Scotland by winning all but one of the 11 races.


From Atlanta to Athens


On graduating to senior level, he won his first world title in Tenerife (ESP) in 1995 and a second the following year in Cape Town (RSA). A few months later came the first of his two Olympic golds, at Atlanta 1996, where he finished in the top three in every one of the 11 races to win convincingly from Ainslie. The British sailor gained revenge at Sydney 2000, leaving Scheidt to pick up silver. Choosing to stay in Laser, the Brazilian showcased his gift for bouncing back four years later in Athens, mastering the light winds at the Agios Kosmas Olympic Sailing Centre to land a second gold and his third medal in consecutive Games.


From Beijing to London


It was then that Scheidt decided to try his hand at Star, the king of all Olympic sailing classes. Partnering Bruno Prada, he won another silver at Beijing 2008, where he also had the honour of carrying the national flag at the opening ceremony, and added a bronze to his medal collection at London 2012. His record of two golds, two silvers and that one bronze has taken him ahead of Torben Grael as Brazil’s greatest Olympic sailor of all time and one of the country’s most successful athletes ever. In the meantime, he has also won 17 world championship medals, 12 of them golds, the last of them coming in the Laser class in 2013.


The fire still burns


“I think these five Olympic Games represent a life dedicated to sport, a life in which I have invested all my energies and all my time in making the absolute most of my potential as an athlete,” says Scheidt. “I am very proud of that, because each time has been a different story for me. You have to keep the flame inside you alive.” By constantly reinventing himself, renewing his objectives at each step of his career and continually looking forward in a bid to stay competitive, Scheidt has been able to put together one of the great Olympic careers.

The pair were one of the youngest crews at the Sydney Olympics and were not expected to challenge to the medal positions. They exceeded expectations and missed a medal by a solitary point. In contrast a rich vein of form which included a European title and a bronze at the world Championship meant they were considered as one of the favourites for the Athens Olympics. They eventually won silver medals after being contenders for the gold right up until the final race. Rogers and Glanfield were silver medal winners at both the European and World Championships in 2006, then added a second Olympic silver in Beijing before ending their partnerships. Rogers continued sailing with other partners but failed in an attempt to qualify for the 2012 Olympics. Both his father and uncles were sailors and both competed with success in the Admiral’s Cup.

For a long time one of the top doubles players in the world Lee Hyo-Jeong had not won any major championships until the 2008 Olympics. In both the mixed and women's doubles tournament, Lee had the fortune that the top seeded couple was eliminated in an earlier round. Fourth seeds themselves, she and Lee Gyeong-Won advanced into the women's doubles final, where they lost to Du Ying and Yu Yang. Lee wasn't even seeded in the mixed event, but with Lee Yong-Dae she beat the two top Indonesian duos in the semi-final and final to claim an upset gold medal. Lee, fairly tall for a Korean, also played on the South Korean team when it upset the Chinese in the 2003 final of the Sudirman Cup. She also played and won the decisive match in the 2010 Uber Cup final, again upsetting the Chinese team. In World Championships, Lee has earned two bronze medals, one in 2005 (doubles, with Lee Gyeong-Won) and one in 2009 (mixed, with Lee Yong-Dae). In 2008, Lee also won her only All-England Championships title through 2011, in the women's doubles.

American beach volleyball star Misty May‐Treanor enjoyed a record‐breaking career, which came to a glorious end with a third consecutive Olympic title at London 2012.


A golden swansong in London


After completing a two‐set victory over fellow USA duo April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the London 2012 final, Misty May‐Treanor and Kerri Walsh‐Jennings turned and fell into each other’s arms, overcome by the emotion of winning their third Olympic women’s beach volleyball title in a row. In doing so, they put together a 21‐match winning run, losing just a solitary set on the way, to Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London.


At the end of it all, May‐Treanor called time on her 13‐year career on the professional world beach volleyball circuit, during which she became one half of the most successful pair the sport has ever seen. “The first two gold medals it was more about volleyball,” she said after stepping down from the podium in London. “The friendship we had was there, but it was volleyball, volleyball, volleyball. This was so much more about the friendship, the togetherness, the journey – and volleyball was just a small part of it.”


Indoor beginnings


The daughter of Butch May, a member of the USA men’s volleyball team at Mexico City 1968, Misty May, as she then was, was introduced to the sport by her parents on the beach in Santa Monica, California. During her childhood years she met some of the greatest names in the sport, among them future triple Olympic champion Karch Kiraly, who sometimes baby‐sat for her.


May went on to become an outstanding indoor volleyball player herself, excelling at school and university and forming part of the Long Beach State 49ers side that recorded 36 consecutive wins in the 1998/99 NCAA Championship season, during which she set a new tournament record for service aces and was named the competition’s most outstanding player.


A record‐breaking partnership


After promptly falling out of love with the indoor game, May decided at the age of 22 to become a professional beach volleyball player. Teaming up with Holly McPeak, she competed in her first Olympics at Sydney 2000, where the pair eventually finished fifth. She then found a new partner in Kerri Walsh. Together they would dominate the domestic and global scene for years to come.


Arriving at Athens 2004 on the back of a 90‐match unbeaten run, the US twosome went on to win the competition without dropping a set, defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil 21‐17, 21‐11 in the gold‐medal match. FIVB world champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, they had gone 101 matches and 18 tournaments unbeaten by the time Beijing 2008 came around, and completed their Olympic title defence by seeing off No1‐ranked Chinese duo Tian Jia and Wang Jie.


Time‐out and a three‐peat


In between her first two Olympic triumphs, May married the baseball player Matt Treanor, while her partner Walsh took time out after Beijing to have two children with her husband, the volleyball player Casey Jennings. May‐Treanor then ruptured an Achilles tendon on the US TV show Dancing with the Stars, an injury that sidelined her for more than a year.


After failing to reach the heights with interim partner Nicole Branagh in 2010, May‐Treanor was reunited with Walsh‐Jennings the following year, with the pair setting their sights on an unprecedented third Olympic gold. After booking their place at London 2012 with a silver in the worlds in Rome that June, they duly achieved their golden goal, consolidating their place in the history of the sport and bowing out with a series of records that will take some beating.


Now a guest lecturer, brand spokesperson and prominent media figure, May‐Treanor fulfilled another long‐cherished dream in June 2014, giving birth to a daughter.

Nicknamed “Six Feet of Sunshine”, Kerri Walsh-Jennings formed part of the greatest pairing beach volleyball has ever seen, teaming up with Misty May-Treanor to win three Olympic gold medals and three world titles and go unbeaten for a remarkable 112 games. On returning to the Olympic stage at Rio 2016 with a new partner, April Ross, she won bronze at the age of 37. 





An Olympic debut, indoors 


Born in California, Kerri Walsh was an exceptionally talented college volleyball player, helping Stanford University win the 1996 and 1997 NCAA titles and being named MVP in both finals, against Hawai’i and Penn State respectively. She was also only the second college volleyball player in history to feature in the All-American first-team four years in a row.


Walsh was only 22 when she made her Olympic debut, at Sydney 2000, with the USA volleyball team. Beaten in five sets by Russia in the semi-finals, the Americans finished out of the medals after losing to Brazil in the match for third place. Though Walsh had already begun suffering the shoulder problems that would dog her throughout her career, her ailment did lead her to improve her tactical understanding and reading of the game and enhance her sense of positioning. 





The greatest pairing of all time 


Also competing for the USA at Sydney 2000 was Misty May-Treanor, who partnered Holly McPeak in beach volleyball, with the pair ending the competition in fifth place. After the Games, May-Treanor invited Walsh to join her, setting the wheels in motion for what would become the most successful tandem in the history of women’s beach volleyball. 


May and Walsh began their long reign on the domestic and global scenes in 2001, going on to dominate proceedings on the U.S. professional tour and at the Olympics and FIVB World Championships. Unbeaten in 90 matches when they arrived at Athens 2004, the USA duo swept all before them at the Faliro Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre, winning every match in straight sets and crowning their majestic run by defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar 21-17, 21-11 in the final. 


World champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, May and Walsh were on a 101-match and 18-tournament winning streak when they began their Olympic title defence at Beijing 2008. After cruising through to the final, they beat China’s No1-ranked Tian Jia and Wang Jie in two sets to retain the gold. They eventually took that unbeaten run to 112 matches.


Threepeat at London 2012 


Walsh, who married fellow beach volleyball player Casey Jennings in 2005 and had two children in the years after Beijing, was back on the sand with May-Treanor in 2011, with the pair setting their sights on a third straight gold at London 2012. 


It duly came their way on the court on Horse Guards Parade, where the two Californians saw off April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in two sets in the final. May-Treanor promptly announced her retirement, having played her part in 21 consecutive wins at the Olympics since 2004, a run in which the fabled American pair lost just one set, against Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London. 


Five Games, four medals


Walsh-Jennings invited Ross to be her new playing partner, before giving birth to a third child in 2013. On returning to competitive action, she and Ross nailed down a place at Rio 2016, where she would go in search of a fourth Olympic title at her fifth Games, at the age of 38. 


The American pair made it to the semi-finals, where they went down 22-20, 21-18 to Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas de Freitas, the only defeat Walsh-Jennings ever suffered in her entire Olympic beach volleyball career. Atoning for that reverse, she and Ross then secured bronze with a three-set win over Brazil’s world-No1 pair Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes.


                                    “As an athlete, I swear this is the hardest match I’ve ever played in my life,” Walsh-Jennings said afterwards. “It was all perseverance.” The effort was worth it. In winning her fourth Olympic medal, the American became the most decorated beach volleyball player in the history of the Games.

Three-time Olympic women’s doubles champions, Venus and Serena Williams have each won four golds at the Games. The elder of the two was also the first to complete the singles and doubles ‘double’, at Sydney 2000, a feat her sibling repeated 12 years later. In winning a fifth medal – mixed doubles silver – at Rio 2016, Venus became the most decorated tennis player in Olympic history since 1896.


Sister actOne of five siblings, Venus Williams was born in Lynwood, California, 15 months before her sister and future doubles partner, Serena. Their father Richard was determined that his daughters would be tennis champions and took on the role of coaching them himself from a very young age. Venus and Serena were both quick to develop their physical strength (Venus was already producing serves in excess of 160 km/h by the age of 10), winning numerous tournaments across the USA as they progressed through the age categories. Venus turned professional when she was just 14. Three years later, in 1997, she became the first unseeded player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam final, at the US Open, only to be outclassed by Switzerland’s Martina Hingis.First Olympic titlesIt was Serena who kickstarted the Williams sisters’ era of Grand Slam domination, claiming the US Open title in 1999. The following year, Venus won the first of her own Grand Slam titles, triumphing at Wimbledon and then the US Open, defeating fellow American Lindsay Davenport on both occasions. Straight after her victory in New York, she headed for Sydney, where she powered past Russia’s Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-4 to win Olympic gold in the women’s singles final. The following day she teamed up with Serena for the women’s doubles final, with the sisters taking just 49 minutes to dispatch Dutch pair Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans 6-1, 6-1. In the process, Venus became the first woman to win the singles and doubles at the same Games since Helen Wills Moody in 1924. It was the start of the Williams sisters’ longstanding love affair with the Olympic doubles tournament. Speaking after that first win, Venus said: “For me, this is almost bigger than singles. To have a victory like this with Serena, my sister, a member of my family and my best friend, doesn't happen often. It's very rare. Just to be able to play and win together at this level is really huge.” Winning together was something the sisters would go on to do on many occasions in the years that followed. Williams vs Williams In 2001, Venus and Serena became the first sisters to contest a major tournament final when they faced off at the US Open. On that occasion it was the elder sibling who came out on top. In February 2002, Venus was confirmed as world No1, going on to face, and lose against, her sister in a remarkable series of four consecutive Grand Slam finals (from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian). Meanwhile, Venus, whose career was later disrupted by a series of injuries, made Wimbledon her own, winning the event a total of five times. The last of those victories came against Serena in 2008, with the two then joining forces on Centre Court to land a record 14th Grand Slam doubles title.Olympic treble An injury to Serena in August 2004 forced the sisters to withdraw from the women’s doubles in Athens, though they were on top again in 2008 and 2012. In Beijing, they overcame Spain’s Anabel Medina and Virginia Ruano 6-2, 6-0, and on the Wimbledon grass four years later they swept aside Czech duo Andrea Hlavacova and Lucie Hradeck 6-4, 6-4, with Venus securing the gold with a sumptuous backhand volley. “Crazy,” said Serena, who had won the singles final the previous day. “I'm always copying her. I forgot that she did it in Sydney and I do it here. We're the same doubles team, we just split this to singles, so it's cool.”Silver lining in Rio Venus remained a fixture on the WTA Tour in the years that followed. Though major singles titles were no longer coming her way, she did win a sixth Wimbledon women’s doubles title with her sister in 2016, taking to 14 their unbeaten run in Grand Slam finals since 1999. Their proud record of winning every Olympic women’s doubles competition they entered ended at Rio 2016, where they lost 6-3, 6-4 in the first round to Czech pair Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova. Venus tumbled out of the singles at the same stage, beaten in three sets by Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens. She gave herself a chance of becoming the first tennis player – male or female – of all time to win five Olympic golds by reaching the mixed doubles final with Rajeev Ram. It was not to be, however, as their compatriots Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock edged them out 10-7 in the final set. That silver was nevertheless an historic one: it made Venus the most decorated of Olympic tennis player of them all.

With six Olympics, Juan Esteban Curuchet is the cyclist with the most participations, and among women only the incomparable Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli has surpassed him. Curuchet débuted at the Olympics in 1984, when the points race, Curuchet's specialty was first held at the Games. Curuchet came in fifth, a position he repeated at the Seoul Games. He then turned professional, thus missing the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. Instead, he earned his first international championship medal, finishing third in the points race at the World Championships. It was the first of 12 medals at the World Championships, all won in either the Madison or the points race. His only title came in 2004, when Walter Pérez and Curuchet rode to Madison gold. Four years later, the pair also achieved Olympic success in the same event, winning the first Argentine cycling medal, with Curuchet being 43 years old. His points race abilities also helped him to win five Six Days events, three with his brother Gabriel Curuchet, one with Giovanni Lombardi and one with Pérez. Apart from the track, Curuchet also regularly appeared in road races, mostly in South America. He was a decent time trialist, and he won the Argentine title in that discipline three times (1998, 2002, 2009). At the Pan American Games, Curuchet earned five medals for Argentina, winning the Madison in 1999 (with his brother), 2003 and 2007 (with Pérez), adding to the two silver medals he had won back in 1983 in the points race and in 1987 in the team pursuit.

One of the great tactical endurance racers on the track, Joan Llaneras won a total of nine major titles in the points race and Madison. In all, Llaneras won seven World Championships, four in the points race (1996, 1998, 2000 and 2007), and three in the Madison (1997, 1999, 2006). Two of his Madison world titles were won with Isaac Gálvez, who tragically died after a fall in the six-days of Gent in 2006. His only Madison event after Gálvez’ death came at the 2008 Olympics, where Llaneras won silver. It was his fourth Olympic medal, having earlier won the 2000 and 2008 points race, while winning the 2004 silver medal in that event. He retired after the Beijing Olympics.

Slovakian twin brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner won three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the C-2 canoe double competition between 2000 and 2008. They are determined to make up for the disappointment of London 2012 – where they had to make do with bronze – by adding to their golden haul at Rio 2016.


Canoeing pedigree


Peter and Pavol Hochschorner were born into a family of canoeing enthusiasts in Bratislava (SVK); their father, who is also their coach, and mother had both represented Czechoslovakia in the slalom, while their sister, who works as their manager, has competed in sprint events for Slovakia. In fact, it was in that discipline that the twins initially took to the water, before opting for the intensity of whitewater slaloming. 





“We have never raced with anyone else, so we have built up our own communication,” Peter explained at London 2012. “Most of the time we are just synchronised.”


Glory in Sydney


As they prepared for the final of the Olympic men’s slalom C-2 competition on 20 September 2000 at Penrith Whitewater Stadium near Sydney, Pavol and Peter, both 21, were in a confident mood, having previously been twice crowned European champions (in 1998 and 2000) and having won a silver medal at the 1999 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships.


The brothers proceeded to produce two excellent runs, particularly second time out, where their coordination and fluidity were on full display in a faultless performance. With the two fastest times, they claimed their first Olympic title, finishing comfortably ahead of Krzysztof Kołomański and Michał Staniszewski (POL). 


In the years between Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004, they continued to achieve striking results, amassing victories in several ICF Canoe Slalom World Cups, the 2002 ECA European Championships and the 2002 World Championships.


Gold in Athens and Beijing


On 19 August 2004 at the Hellenikon Olympic Complex to the south of Athens, Pavol and Peter put in a series of marvellous displays, impressing the watching public by posting the fastest times of the preliminary round, semi-final and final. 


Further successes followed in the World Cup, European Championships and World Championships (in 2007 and 2009), and in the 2008 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. In the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, they again emerged from the qualifying round with the best time, but they fell to second position after their semi-final run. On 15 August, however, the Hochschorners surged to a third successive Olympic victory, becoming the first competitors to achieve such a feat in the C-2 category.


London letdown


During the London Games in 2012, the dominant Slovakian pair were taken by surprise by the potency of the challenges provided by the British duos of Timothy Baillie/Etienne Stott and David Florence/Richard Hounslow at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, and were forced to settle for the bronze medal after incurring a two-second penalty for hitting a slalom gate. 


“It was a horrible sensation in London, as we didn’t perform well and we knew that one penalty could cost us a place on the podium,” said Peter. “But in the end, we were happy to have won a medal for Slovakia.”


Focus on Rio


The nine-time European champions and six-time world champions, who boast eight other medals at the Worlds and have topped the overall World Cup standings a record 10 times, will go in search of a fifth Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when they will be 36 years of age. 


“The domestic qualifiers for the Rio Games will be very intense, as we have many talented Slovakian canoeists,” said Pavol. “Once we have guaranteed our place, it would be great to win gold again. There’s a series of young competitors in our category and it will be interesting to face them. We will try to make our experience count.”

A professional athlete since the age of 18, Sara Renner's parents operated a ski lodge in Alberta that was the perfect setting for her to hone her talents. After a disappointing 1998 Winter Olympics, which led to the funding for the Canadian Women's National Cross-Country Skiing Team to be cut, she became the first Canadian and female North American to win a World Championship medal in the sport with bronze in the individual sprint in 2005. In the meantime she had won silver at the 2001 World Cup in the relay event and improved her standings at the 2002 Winter Olympics. From 2005-2006 she took two more bronze medals at World Cup events, as well as one silver, but her most memorable story came from the 2006 Winter Olympics. In the Team Sprint event she won silver after Norwegian coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen gave her a ski pole to replace one that had been accidentally broken by one of the other competitors. Norway's team ended up fourth in the event, ostensibly losing their chance at a medal because of this act of sportsmanship, and both Håkensmoen, the Norwegian embassy, and the Norwegian Olympic Committee were showered with gifts from Canadians to show their gratitude.


Interested in sport causes, Renner posed nude for a ""Nordic Nudes"" calendar to help raise money for the Canadian Women's Nordic Ski Team in 2001. After failing to medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics, she announced her retirement at the conclusion of the 30 km event. She is married to Olympic Alpine Skier Thomas Grandi.

Since attending the Junior National Championships in 1988, she has obtained a total of seventeen medals in World Cup events for cross-country skiing. Although she saw little success at her first Olympic Winter Games in 1998, she managed to win bronze in the Women’s 10km pursuit event in 2002 (the first Olympic medal won by a North American woman in cross-country skiing), a medal that was later upgraded to gold after the previous first and second place athletes, Olga Danilova and Larissa Lazutina respectively, failed drug tests. After winning a silver medal in the Women’s Team Sprint event at the 2006 Winter Games, she retired from the sport as Canada most decorated cross-country skier. 


Since joining the World Anti-Doping Agency’s athlete committee in 2005, Scott has engaged herself in other aspects of sport, including volunteering her time for UNICEF and Right to Play. In 2006 she was elected as an athlete member of the IOC and joined the 2010 Vancouver Organizing Committee’s board of directors the same year. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Waterloo. She is married to retired American cross-country skier Justin Wadsworth.

Wolfgang and Andréas Linger started practising luge on the Igls Olympic track, used for the Innsbruck Games in 1964 and 1976. These two brothers, who are not twins, started out in the one-man events. It was only five years later that they teamed up. At the 2002 Games, the Linger brothers became part of the world luge elite, but did not do enough to win any titles. After two good races, they finished sixth at the Salt Lake City Games.


The Cesana track - cursed, then blessed


The following year was a revelation – firstly coming fourth in the World Cup, they went on to dominate all their opponents to win the 2003 World Championship title on the Sigulda track in Latvia. But everything looked as if it was coming to an end in 2005 at Cesana in Italy, on the future Olympic track, where they came off in the last bend but one.


Wolfgang had a higher price to pay, fracturing his ankle and fibula. But his passion for luge was too great. He rejoined the circuit the following year with his brother. The two brothers had another rendezvous with Cesana for the Turin Olympic Games in 2006. This time, they did not come off the track; they won the first race and finished second in the next one. It was a victory for the Austrian brothers – they were Olympic champions!


Rising to the major challenges


Between 2006 and 2010, the Linger brothers were still near the top, but did not win any major victories. Arriving in Vancouver, they knew that it was not going to be easy and that their opponents were very strong. The Latvians, Germans, Italians and Americans were bound to be formidable competitors.


On 17 February, the two heats of the doubles event were held. From the first intermediate times, the two Austrians were in the lead. They passed the finish line with an average time of 135 kmh. The Latvian Sic brothers came in eight-hundredths of a second behind then, followed by the German pair 23-hundredths of a second later. There was one heat left to race, and the pressure was on Wolfgang and Andréas. They made a perfect start and did not commit a single error on the whole run. Although slower than in the first heat, they were still in the lead in this second round. There was no doubt that they were the champions today, winning their second gold medal. They were the first lugers to retain their Olympic title in this event since the East Germans, Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn, in 1976 and 1980.

Gerhard Plankensteiner began international racing in 1986, competing in various youth categories in singles, winning one gold at the Junior World Championships. On the senior level he made his début in the World Cup in the 1989-90 season, winning his first podium in singles in February 1990 and the first of a total of five victories in doubles in January 1995. In the overall standings of the World Cup Plankensteiner was ranked second in doubles in 1997. He took part in five editions of the Winter Olympics making his début in singles in Albertville in 1992. His other four appearances were all in doubles, highlighted by the bronze medal in Torino in 2006 together with Oswald Haselrieder. He finished his career when Haselrieder was seriously injured in March 2010. 


Winning the Olympic bronze medalist in Torino was overshadowed in Italy due to an incident that occurred immediately after the race. Plankensteiner, when asked by a journalist whether in case of victory he would have sung the national anthem replied\: ""I do not know that song"", thus triggering a controversy in the national press and the political world. Almost immediately, Plankensteiner, a German native speaker, gave his version of events. He declared that he had misunderstood the question because of the emotion of the moment and because he did not speak the Italian language well, not having understood that the Mameli anthem was just another way of referring to the national anthem of the Italian Republic.


At the World Championships Plankensteiner won four bronze medals in doubles and team, and two golds, the gold medals coming in 1989, at age 17 in the team event, and in doubles in 2009. He also received a silver medal and five bronze medals at the European Championships and won four Italian national titles, all in doubles.


In 2006 Plankensteiner was appointed as a member of the Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He married Susi Erdmann, a five-time Olympian and triple medalist in luge and bobsleigh events. He later worked as a forest policeman and the couple settled in Rasun-Anterselva.

Oswald Haselrieder began international sliding in 1988, competing in various junior categories both in singles and doubles. His best results at the Junior World Championships were two third places in singles and a victory in doubles with Dietmar Pierhofer. This partnership broke up in 1995, when Haselrieder joined forces with Gerhard Plankensteiner, with whom he achieved most of his most important successes. On the senior level, Haselrieder made his World Cup début in the 1993-94 season, making his first podium in December 1993 in singles, with the first of his five doubles victories coming in January 1995. In the overall standings of the World Cup he was ranked second in doubles in 1996-97.


During his career Haselrieder took part in five Winter Olympics making his début in singles at Albertville in 1992. His other four appearances were all in doubles with the bronze medal in Torino in 2006 the highlight. The last race of his career was at the 2010 Winter Olympics, as his career ended due to a serious injury sustained in training in March 2010. At the World Championships Haselrieder won three bronze medals in doubles and the team event and one gold medal in doubles in 2009. He also received a silver medal and six bronze medals at European Championships and won four Italian Championships, all in doubles. 


In 2006 Haselrieder was appointed the Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He later became a member of the technical staff of the national team. He married Doris Haselrieder, herself an excellent former natural track luger, winning a bronze medal at Worlds as well as one gold and one silver in the European Championships.

It would take a long, long time to list all of André Lange’s achievements, all those titles, wins and gold medals. To mention only the best, André Lange is a four-time Olympic champion, eight-time world champion and eight-time European champion, with 36 World Cup wins and 5 general ranking victories.


Langen and Lange


In 1998, Lange was still too young to compete at the Games in Nagano, so he won the junior World Championships hands down instead. The top bobsledder at the time was Germany’s Christoph Langen, the reigning Olympic champion. Four years later in Salt Lake City, the two men shared top billing and the gold medals: Langen driving the two-man bob and Lange driving the second German four-man bob.


In 2006, André Lange competed in the two events on the programme of the Games in Turin. Of the eight runs with his team, he won five, also finishing second twice and fourth once. For André and his partners, including Kevin Kuske, his loyal pusher since the start, recognition had arrived: they were two-time Olympic champions.


Silver for one-hundredth; gold at the end


In Vancouver in 2010, André Lange was still one of the bobsleigh favourites. In tribute to his prestigious career, he was chosen as his team’s flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony. Beaten by the Americans in the four-man bob, Lange and his partners took the silver medal by one-hundredth of a second in the final run, beating the Canadians. In the two-man bob, André made good use of his experience. Second in the first run, he won the next three and his fourth Olympic title. Until he and his partner Kuske came along, nobody before had ever managed to win four gold medals in bobsleigh. André Lange can take a well-deserved retirement.

He has also won the combined men's event four times, the two-man six times (the only man in World Cup history to achieve this) and the four-man once at the World Cup. Bobsled, however, was not Leuders' first athletic choice and trained to be a decathlete until 1989. He turned down an offer to carry the Canadian Flag at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympics, preferring to focus on training and preparation for the competitions. One of the turns at the Whistler Sliding Center, a venue for bobsled, luge and skeleton at the 2010 Olympics, is named ""Lueders Loop"" in his honor.

A golden generationWith 37 medals – 19 of them gold – Romania is among the most successful ever nations in the Olympic rowing events. That success is due in very large measure to four exceptional female rowers:  Elisabeta Lipa, Doina Ignat, Viorica Susanu and Georgeta Andrunache (nee Damian). This quartet dominated their events in the late 1990s and throughout the first decade of the new millennium. Andrunache, the youngest of the four, competed in four editions of the Games between Sydney in 2000 and London 2012, winning five gold medals in the eights and the coxless pairs; together with Lipa, she holds the joint record for the most Olympic titles won by an oarswoman.


Triumph in Sydney


On 23 September 2000 in Penrith, which was the centre for the rowing, kayak and canoe events in Sydney, Damian and Ignat found themselves up against reigning Olympic champions Missy Ryan and Karen Kraft in the final of the women’s coxless pairs. However, the American duo were no match for the Romanians who powered across the line 1.5 seconds ahead of them to claim gold.


Golden hat-trick in the pairs


Damian went on to form a partnership with Viorica Susanu, and together they set a new 2000m world record at the 2002 World Championships with a time of 6.53.80. The duo carried that form into the Olympic Games in Athens two years later. In the coxless pairs final on 14 August 2004 in Schinias, they launched a powerful break at the halfway mark to which the pursuing British, Belarusian, Canadian and German crews had no answer, and the Romanian duo cruised over the line for a clear victory. Damian and Susanu were back to defend their title in Beijing, and on 16 August 2008 achieved another impressive victory by a margin of almost two seconds, this time over China’s Wu You et Gao Yulan. Damian thus joined that elite club of Olympians who have won gold in the same event at three successive editions of the Games. 


Two golds in the eights


Damian was also part of the Romanian eight that won successive World Championship titles in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and was drafted into the crew at Sydney 2000 that successfully defended the Olympic title won by Romania four years earlier in Atlanta, before she was on the team. Ast Athens 2004, they defended their gold in the eights yet again, a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact that Damian and Susanu had only 24 hours to recover after their victory in the coxless pairs. Finally, at Beijing 2008, Damian and her coxless pairs partner were part of the octet that took bronze behind the USA and the Netherlands. 


London swansong


After 20 years competing at the top level, Damian, who is married to fellow rower Valeriu, decided to lay down her oars after Beijing, and took time out to have a second child. However, she was back ahead of London 2012, where she made a bid to win a third gold in the coxless pairs with Susanu. The pair reached the final but could only manage fifth place, at which point she called time on her career for the second and last time.

Romania’s Viorica Susanu competed in four editions of the Games, in both the coxless pairs and in the eights, winning five medals, three of them gold.


A golden generation


Born on the banks of the Danube, in the town of Galatj, Viorica Susanu was part of a golden generation for Romanian women’s rowing. A member of the eight that won consecutive World Championships in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and claimed Olympic gold at Sydney 2000, she subsequently went on to enjoy similar success in the coxless pairs, rowing with Georgeta Andrunache. During the final of the 2002 World Championships in Seville, the duo set a new world record of 6:53.80 as they finished over four seconds ahead of Canadian pair Jacqui Cook and Karen Clark.


Unbeatable in Athens


At the Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre at Athens 2004, Susanu and her Romanian oarswomen were at the peak of their powers. In the final of the coxless pairs on 21 August, she and Andranuche were untouchable. Leading from the start, by the halfway point they had established a gap of over two seconds, which they maintained into the finish. The following day, Susanu won her third Olympic gold in a Romanian eight that was every bit as dominant, again winning by over two seconds ahead of the American and Dutch boats in second and third.


Mixed fortunes in Beijing


In the final of the coxless pairs on 16 August 2008 at the Olympic rowing park in Shunyi, Andrunache and Susanu were once again in imperious form as they completed the defence of the title, leaving Chinese pair Wu You and Gao Yulan and Yuliya Bichyk and Natalia Helakh of Belarus to battle it out for the other podium spots. Twenty four hours  later, they were back in action in the final of the eights, but this time found themselves out-rowed by the USA crew, and then pipped at the finish line by the Dutch boat, to finish third.


Final fling in London


By the time London 2012 came around, Susanu and Andrunache were 36 and 35 respectively, and both now mothers. Despite four years away from competition, they finished fifth in the coxless pairs final, at which point they announced their retirement. Asked to name her favourite race during 10 years at the top, Susanu replied: “They are all equally magnificent if they end in a gold medal.” With two European titles, five world titles and four Olympic golds, Susanu enjoyed a career that was full of magnificent moments.

Born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Katherine Grainger took up rowing at the age of 18, and won her first major medal in the eight at the 1997 World Championships in Aiguebelette (FRA), where she helped Great Britain collect bronze. She made her Olympic debut at Sydney 2000, where she teamed up with Guin and Miriam Batten, and Gillian Lindsay to win silver in the quadruple sculls behind Germany. It was the first medal of her storied association with the Games.


Yet more silver


Grainger then joined forces with Catherine Bishop in the coxless pair, with the duo winning the world title in Milan in 2003 and going on to collect silver behind Romania’s invincible Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu at Athens 2004.


That second Olympic silver was followed by a third four years later in Beijing, where Grainger, Annabel Vernon, Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton were narrowly beaten by the Chinese quartet in the quadruple sculls, an event in which the Scottish rower had helped Great Britain win three consecutive world titles between 2005 and 2007. 


A winning combination


In 2010, Grainger linked up with Cambridge University rower Anna Watkins in the double sculls, the pair proving such an effective partnership that they went 23 races unbeaten, winning back-to-back world titles in 2010 and 2011 to take the Scot’s haul of world golds to six. With their powerful, instinctive sprint finish, boundless confidence and graceful and perfectly synchronised stroke, Grainger and Watkins were a perfect match on the water.


Wait for gold ends


Grainger was 36 by the time she set off in search of Olympic medal number four on home water at London 2012, with Watkins again in the boat with her. Lining up in the double sculls final in blustery conditions at Eton Dorney, the British pair took an early lead from Australia’s Brooke Pratley and Kim Crow and stretched it to half a length by the 500m mark.


Grainger and Watkins were still forcing the pace at the halfway stage and maintained it to record a famous and much-celebrated victory by a length. The long-awaited gold cemented the Scot’s status as one of the most gifted rowers of all time and erased memories of the narrow defeat to the Chinese four years earlier, which had led her to contemplate retirement.


“Worth the wait,” said Grainger, after receiving a congratulatory hug from fellow British rowing legend Sir Steve Redgrave. “Steve promised me there’d be tears of joy this time, which there are. I feel this medal of all of them is the people’s medal. I feel so many people have been behind me and supported me and wanted this for me as much as I have.


“It’s the fulfilment of a lot of blood, sweat and tears but it doesn’t all sink in. Any Olympic medal is a phenomenal achievement but having had three in the past I wanted a gold one to complete the collection.”


Time for a break


Taking a two-year sabbatical from rowing, Grainger completed a PhD in criminal psychology at King’s College, London, did a bit of TV commentary work and wrote an autobiography entitled Dreams Do Come True. In late 2014, however, having been made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the previous year, she decided to return to the British rowing team. And despite turning 40, Grainger, who was also named chancellor of Oxford Brookes University in March 2015, managed to qualify for her fifth straight Games, in the double sculls. Her new partner, Victoria Thornley, was 12 years her junior.


A silver swansong in Rio


After placing second in both their heat and their semi-final, Grainger and Thornley set off in search of gold in the final, where they would fight it out with Poland’s Magdalena Fularczyk-Kozłowska and Natalia Mataj.


In the lead at 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m, where they held an advantage of 1.25 seconds, the British duo were reeled in by their Polish rivals in the closing 200m and finished nearly a second off the pace in second, well ahead of Lithuania’s Donata Vištartaitė and Milda Valčiukaitė in third.


“Mum and Dad, I promise: I will never put you through that again,” announced Grainger immediately after making it five medals in five Games to set a new British record. “They’ve been through it five times with me. They weren’t sure if coming back was the right thing for me and they’ve been so supportive since I did. We all know it was the right decision now. But at the same time, I think maybe that’s enough.” 


                                    The veteran added: “I have had my happiest and hardest days on the water. The closest friendships I’ve made have been through this sport and it’s hard to imagine it not being my life in some way. I’ll never leave it and it’ll never leave me but I look forward to not setting my alarm for dawn and waking up as late as I want.”

Elise Laverick originally planned to be a professional musician and studied at the famed Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. She is highly skilled at both violin and double bass. Encouraged by her mother, a former international rower, she began to row at the age of 17.


By 1997 she had developed enough to become part of the national eight and was a bronze medallist with that crew at her first appearance in a world championship. She regularly switched boat classes until 2004 when she formed a partnership with [Sarah Winckless] in the double sculls. The highlight of this partnership came at the Olympic Games where they overhauled a Chines pair in the closing stages to win a bronze medal. A few weeks later she suffered a setback whilst riding her bicycle in London. She suffered a broken hip, fractured hand and facial damage when she was knocked off her bicycle by a hit-and-run driver.  After several operations she returned to rowing six months later.


Eighteen months before the Athens Olympics she formed a new partnership with Anna Bebington which gave Laverick the second world medal of her career, another bronze, at the championships in Germany. At the 2008 Olympics the pairing figured in one of the closest races of the regatta when they finished third but less than a quarter of a second behind the New Zealand champions. She retired after the Games and began training to be a solicitor.

Just three table tennis players have managed to win four Olympic gold medals, Deng Yaping, Zhang Yining and Wang Nan. These three have dominated women’s table tennis for successive periods, with Wang succeeding Deng, and Zhang replacing Wang at the top of the pantheon. Wang Nan was ranked number one in the world for almost four years between 1999 and 2002, and she won all the major titles in that period, including the singles and doubles title at the 2000 Olympics. At the next two Olympics, she won two more golds, in the doubles event (with Zhang) and the 2008 team event. In singles, she was defeated in the 2004 quarter-finals, and in the 2008 final, losing out to Zhang. At the World Championships Wang has won no less than 15 titles, three in singles, five in doubles, six in the team event, and one in mixed doubles. Wang ended her career after the Beijing Olympics, at which point she had already been enshrined in the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Hall of Fame for several years.

Underlining her dominance, Zhang is also a four-time winner of the World Cup, and has won the Pro Tour Grand Final on six occasions. She was ranked first on the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) World Ranking from January 2003 through November 2009, only dropping to second during two months in 2008. She began a career-break after her marriage in 2009, but plans to return in London for two more gold medals.

14693   Rob Hayles  (M-GBR-CYC / 1996)The son of a sprint cyclist turned coach; Rob Hayles worked at a brewery at the time he made the shortlist for the British team for the Barcelona Olympic Games. Although he eventually missed selection for the team pursuit he had established himself as a rising star and in 1993 won the national title in the kilometre time trial. This was the first of what would become fifteen national track titles in four separate disciplines, the kilometre, individual pursuit, madison and points race. After an inauspicious Olympic début in 1996 he suffered ill luck at the Sydney Games missing a medal in the individual pursuit then being brought down in a multi-rider crash whilst in second place in the Madison. Later in 2000 he won his first world championship medals on home boards in Manchester. For the next three years he concentrated on road racing and signed to ride for the French Cofidis team but a serious car crash in which he suffered a triple fracture of the pelvis impeded his progress and his only performance of note during his three seasons with Cofidis was a second place at the British Road Race Championships in 2002. At the end of 2003 he returned to the track and rejoined the British pursuit team to place second at the World Championships. This feat was repeated at the Athens Olympics and he also partnered [Bradley Wiggins] to bronze in the Madison. 


His two world title victories were both recorded in 2005. A win as part of the team pursuit was not unexpected but his victory in the Madison alongside a precocious teenager called Mark Cavendish was a major surprise. The success continued in 2006 with appearances on the podium at the Commonwealth Games and Track World Championship but this proved to be the high point of his career. Suspended from the 2008 World Championship due to a high haematocrit level, he was overlooked for the Beijing Olympics and retired from the track at the end of the year though he did have of the satisfaction of being crowned British road race champion during the summer.


Hayles continued to race in British domestic road racing for a further three seasons until announcing his retirement in 2011. By then he had also begun a career as a television and radio commentator. He is married to former Olympic swimmer Vicki Horner.

Excelling on road and track, Bradley Wiggins is Great Britain’s most decorated Olympian with eight medals, just ahead of fellow cyclists Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny. Wiggins stepped up to the podium at every Olympic Games from Sydney 2000 to Rio 2016, collecting five golds along the way. 


Big ambitions


Born in Ghent (BEL), Bradley Wiggins is the son of late Australian cyclist Gary Wiggins, a successful six-day racer in the 1970s and 80s. Wiggins Jr moved to London with his British mother, Linda, when he was a boy and took up cycling, inspired by the sight of Chris Boardman winning individual pursuit gold at Barcelona 1992. Wiggins, who competed in his first race at the age of 12, was so convinced of his abilities that he told one of his teachers: “I'm going to be Olympic champion. I'm going to wear the yellow jersey in the Tour de France.”


A first Olympic medal


The ambitious young cyclist, who would later be mentored by Boardman, honed his skills at the Herne Hill Velodrome in London, which had been built for the 1948 Olympic Games, and specialised in the madison and the pursuit, an event in which he won the 1998 world junior title, at the age of 18. He then got his first taste of the Olympics at Sydney 2000, where he collected bronze in the team pursuit.


A prophesy fulfilled


Wiggins turned professional in 2001, riding for Française des Jeux and Crédit Agricole. Making his second Olympic appearance at Athens 2004, he proved himself a worthy successor to Boardman by winning a total of three medals: gold in the individual pursuit, silver in the team pursuit and bronze in the madison. Following the Games, Wiggins decided to switch to the road, only to return to the track to win individual and team pursuit world titles in Palma de Mallorca (ESP) in 2007. A year later he appeared at his third Games in Beijing, where he became the first rider ever to retain the individual pursuit title. He went on to win the team pursuit crown, with the GB four beating Denmark by 6.7 seconds in the gold medal match and setting a new world record of 3:53.314 in the process. Now the proud owner of six Olympic medals, three of them gold, Wiggins had pulled level with Steve Redgrave as his country’s most successful Olympian of all time.


Taking on the Tour 


Turning his attention back to the road, Wiggins came close to Tour de France glory in 2009, taking third place on the podium. He was not so fortunate in the 2011 race, when he had to retire after breaking a collarbone. The following year would be an entirely different story for the British rider, however, as he tasted both Tour and Olympic glory in the space of a few short weeks.


Annus mirabilis 


After donning the yellow shirt for the first time on stage seven of the 2012 Tour de France, Wiggins stayed in it all the way to the finish line on the Champs Elysées, becoming the first British cyclist ever to win the great event. That rare achievement made “Wiggo” as much of a hero with French cycling fans as it did with his compatriots. Famed for his dry wit, Wiggins then achieved a piece of sporting history a few weeks later at London 2012, where he took the honours in the individual time trial to become the first man to win the Tour de France and Olympic gold in the same year.


Speaking after his magnificent victory on home tarmac, achieved by a margin of 42 seconds from Germany’s Tony Martin, Wiggins said: “It's been an amazing six weeks. This was the plan. I've answered all the questions in the last six weeks.”


More gold in Rio


After being crowned a world road time trial champion for the first time in Ponferrada (ESP) in 2014, Wiggins then went back to the track with the aim of contesting his fifth Games at Rio 2016. His preparations included a successful attempt at the world hour record at the Lee Valley VeloPark in June 2015, with the British legend riding a new best of 54.526km. A seventh track world title – in the madison with Mark Cavendish – then came his way at the same venue in March 2016, and was followed by selection for the Olympic team pursuit in Rio. The British quartet of Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, Owain Doull and the 36-year-old Wiggins kicked off by setting a new world record of 3:50.570 in the first round before going for gold against a determined Australian four in the final. Though the Aussies bettered Great Britain’s gold medal winning time at London 2012, they were no match for the class of 2016, who eclipsed their own world record with a time of 3:50.265, equating to an average of 62.356 km/h over the four-kilometre standing-start race. As irreverent as ever, Wiggins stuck his tongue out on the podium, much to the amusement of his team-mates, and raised the fingers on his right hand to signify his five golds and five Olympic appearances.

At Athens 2004, Nicolás Massú claimed double gold in the men’s singles and doubles (with Fernando González) to secure Chile’s only two Olympic titles to date.


Doubles with González


On Saturday 21 August 2004, on the hard court of the Olympic Tennis Centre in the northern Athens suburb of Maroussi, the Chilean pair of Nicolás Massú and Fernando González took on Germany’s Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schüttler in the men’s doubles tennis final. To reach the showpiece match they had pulled off a surprise 7-5, 6-4 victory over American top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan in the quarter-finals. The gold medal duel would go down in tennis folklore, with Massú and González saving four match points in the fourth set to eventually clinch victory in the fifth (6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4), providing Chile with its first ever Olympic champions in the process.


Happy days


Just 24 hours later, Massú was back on court in the singles final, with only hard court specialist Mardy Fish (USA) standing between him and a second gold. On his way to the final, the South American had beaten Gustavo Kuerten (BRA), Vincent Spadea (USA), Igor Andreev (RUS), world number four Carlos Moya (ESP), and Taylor Dent (USA). Massú clinched the title, but not before engaging in another pulsating contest, finally overcoming the big-serving American 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. “Being here, fighting for a medal and winning gold – all of this is amazing. It’s obviously the happiest day of my career. I suspect that playing tennis all week, winning two medals and making history for your country would be a dream for anyone,” stated the champion, who, with his doubles partner González, remains Chile’s only Olympic title winner.


Doing it the hard way


Massú’s game, which is based on a solid forehand, an accurate backhand and an ability to defend as well as attack from the baseline, is generally better suited to clay courts. It is on that surface that he has obtained his best results on the ATP Tour, triumphing in six tournaments between 2002 and 2006. It made his two Olympic successes all the more remarkable, given that they came on a hard court surface known as DecoTurf. “I was so happy; it will always be my greatest sporting memory. When I look back in 10 years’ time, and then in another 10 years, that’s what I’ll remember, and it’ll make me happy again,” mused the hero of Athens.

Slovakian twin brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner won three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the C-2 canoe double competition between 2000 and 2008. They are determined to make up for the disappointment of London 2012 – where they had to make do with bronze – by adding to their golden haul at Rio 2016.


Canoeing pedigree


Peter and Pavol Hochschorner were born into a family of canoeing enthusiasts in Bratislava (SVK); their father, who is also their coach, and mother had both represented Czechoslovakia in the slalom, while their sister, who works as their manager, has competed in sprint events for Slovakia. In fact, it was in that discipline that the twins initially took to the water, before opting for the intensity of whitewater slaloming. 





“We have never raced with anyone else, so we have built up our own communication,” Peter explained at London 2012. “Most of the time we are just synchronised.”


Glory in Sydney


As they prepared for the final of the Olympic men’s slalom C-2 competition on 20 September 2000 at Penrith Whitewater Stadium near Sydney, Pavol and Peter, both 21, were in a confident mood, having previously been twice crowned European champions (in 1998 and 2000) and having won a silver medal at the 1999 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships.


The brothers proceeded to produce two excellent runs, particularly second time out, where their coordination and fluidity were on full display in a faultless performance. With the two fastest times, they claimed their first Olympic title, finishing comfortably ahead of Krzysztof Kołomański and Michał Staniszewski (POL). 


In the years between Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004, they continued to achieve striking results, amassing victories in several ICF Canoe Slalom World Cups, the 2002 ECA European Championships and the 2002 World Championships.


Gold in Athens and Beijing


On 19 August 2004 at the Hellenikon Olympic Complex to the south of Athens, Pavol and Peter put in a series of marvellous displays, impressing the watching public by posting the fastest times of the preliminary round, semi-final and final. 


Further successes followed in the World Cup, European Championships and World Championships (in 2007 and 2009), and in the 2008 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. In the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, they again emerged from the qualifying round with the best time, but they fell to second position after their semi-final run. On 15 August, however, the Hochschorners surged to a third successive Olympic victory, becoming the first competitors to achieve such a feat in the C-2 category.


London letdown


During the London Games in 2012, the dominant Slovakian pair were taken by surprise by the potency of the challenges provided by the British duos of Timothy Baillie/Etienne Stott and David Florence/Richard Hounslow at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, and were forced to settle for the bronze medal after incurring a two-second penalty for hitting a slalom gate. 


“It was a horrible sensation in London, as we didn’t perform well and we knew that one penalty could cost us a place on the podium,” said Peter. “But in the end, we were happy to have won a medal for Slovakia.”


Focus on Rio


The nine-time European champions and six-time world champions, who boast eight other medals at the Worlds and have topped the overall World Cup standings a record 10 times, will go in search of a fifth Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when they will be 36 years of age. 


“The domestic qualifiers for the Rio Games will be very intense, as we have many talented Slovakian canoeists,” said Pavol. “Once we have guaranteed our place, it would be great to win gold again. There’s a series of young competitors in our category and it will be interesting to face them. We will try to make our experience count.”

Further successes followed in the World Cup, European Championships and World Championships (in 2007 and 2009), and in the 2008 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. In the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, they again emerged from the qualifying round with the best time, but they fell to second position after their semi-final run. On 15 August, however, the Hochschorners surged to a third successive Olympic victory, becoming the first competitors to achieve such a feat in the C-2 category.


London letdown


During the London Games in 2012, the dominant Slovakian pair were taken by surprise by the potency of the challenges provided by the British duos of Timothy Baillie/Etienne Stott and David Florence/Richard Hounslow at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, and were forced to settle for the bronze medal after incurring a two-second penalty for hitting a slalom gate. 


“It was a horrible sensation in London, as we didn’t perform well and we knew that one penalty could cost us a place on the podium,” said Peter. “But in the end, we were happy to have won a medal for Slovakia.”


Focus on Rio


The nine-time European champions and six-time world champions, who boast eight other medals at the Worlds and have topped the overall World Cup standings a record 10 times, will go in search of a fifth Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when they will be 36 years of age.


“The domestic qualifiers for the Rio Games will be very intense, as we have many talented Slovakian canoeists,” said Pavol. “Once we have guaranteed our place, it would be great to win gold again. There’s a series of young competitors in our category and it will be interesting to face them. We will try to make our experience count.”

Stefan Henze was a whitewater canoeist who won a silver medal with Marcus Becker in the Canadian doubles at the 2004 Athina Olympics. In 2003 both became World Champions and in 2008 Henze was team European Champion. He came from a canoeing family, as his father Jürgen and brother Frank were also whitewater paddlers. His father was his first coach in Stefan’s active career. After the 2008 Europeans Henze and Becker did not manage to qualify for London 2012, and they then started a coaching career, training Melanie Pfeifer at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Both belonged to the national coaching stuff of the German Olympic whitewater canoe team.


On 12 August 2016, early in the morning, Henze took a taxi together with sports scientist Christian Käding to drive to the Olympic Village in Rio de Janeiro. The taxi crashed and Henze suffered severe head injuries, which German Olympic chief physician Bernd Wolfarth described as life-threatening. Henze died only three days later, on 15 August, aged only 35 years. An organ donor, his heart, liver, and kidneys went on to save the lives of four other people.

Nicknamed “Six Feet of Sunshine”, Kerri Walsh-Jennings formed part of the greatest pairing beach volleyball has ever seen, teaming up with Misty May-Treanor to win three Olympic gold medals and three world titles and go unbeaten for a remarkable 112 games. On returning to the Olympic stage at Rio 2016 with a new partner, April Ross, she won bronze at the age of 37. 





An Olympic debut, indoors 


Born in California, Kerri Walsh was an exceptionally talented college volleyball player, helping Stanford University win the 1996 and 1997 NCAA titles and being named MVP in both finals, against Hawai’i and Penn State respectively. She was also only the second college volleyball player in history to feature in the All-American first-team four years in a row.


Walsh was only 22 when she made her Olympic debut, at Sydney 2000, with the USA volleyball team. Beaten in five sets by Russia in the semi-finals, the Americans finished out of the medals after losing to Brazil in the match for third place. Though Walsh had already begun suffering the shoulder problems that would dog her throughout her career, her ailment did lead her to improve her tactical understanding and reading of the game and enhance her sense of positioning. 





The greatest pairing of all time 


Also competing for the USA at Sydney 2000 was Misty May-Treanor, who partnered Holly McPeak in beach volleyball, with the pair ending the competition in fifth place. After the Games, May-Treanor invited Walsh to join her, setting the wheels in motion for what would become the most successful tandem in the history of women’s beach volleyball. 


May and Walsh began their long reign on the domestic and global scenes in 2001, going on to dominate proceedings on the U.S. professional tour and at the Olympics and FIVB World Championships. Unbeaten in 90 matches when they arrived at Athens 2004, the USA duo swept all before them at the Faliro Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre, winning every match in straight sets and crowning their majestic run by defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar 21-17, 21-11 in the final. 


World champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, May and Walsh were on a 101-match and 18-tournament winning streak when they began their Olympic title defence at Beijing 2008. After cruising through to the final, they beat China’s No1-ranked Tian Jia and Wang Jie in two sets to retain the gold. They eventually took that unbeaten run to 112 matches.


Threepeat at London 2012 


Walsh, who married fellow beach volleyball player Casey Jennings in 2005 and had two children in the years after Beijing, was back on the sand with May-Treanor in 2011, with the pair setting their sights on a third straight gold at London 2012. 


It duly came their way on the court on Horse Guards Parade, where the two Californians saw off April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in two sets in the final. May-Treanor promptly announced her retirement, having played her part in 21 consecutive wins at the Olympics since 2004, a run in which the fabled American pair lost just one set, against Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London. 


Five Games, four medals


Walsh-Jennings invited Ross to be her new playing partner, before giving birth to a third child in 2013. On returning to competitive action, she and Ross nailed down a place at Rio 2016, where she would go in search of a fourth Olympic title at her fifth Games, at the age of 38. 


The American pair made it to the semi-finals, where they went down 22-20, 21-18 to Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas de Freitas, the only defeat Walsh-Jennings ever suffered in her entire Olympic beach volleyball career. Atoning for that reverse, she and Ross then secured bronze with a three-set win over Brazil’s world-No1 pair Larissa Franca and Talita Antunes.


                                    “As an athlete, I swear this is the hardest match I’ve ever played in my life,” Walsh-Jennings said afterwards. “It was all perseverance.” The effort was worth it. In winning her fourth Olympic medal, the American became the most decorated beach volleyball player in the history of the Games.

American beach volleyball star Misty May‐Treanor enjoyed a record‐breaking career, which came to a glorious end with a third consecutive Olympic title at London 2012.


A golden swansong in London


After completing a two‐set victory over fellow USA duo April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the London 2012 final, Misty May‐Treanor and Kerri Walsh‐Jennings turned and fell into each other’s arms, overcome by the emotion of winning their third Olympic women’s beach volleyball title in a row. In doing so, they put together a 21‐match winning run, losing just a solitary set on the way, to Austria’s Schwaiger sisters in the preliminary round in London.


At the end of it all, May‐Treanor called time on her 13‐year career on the professional world beach volleyball circuit, during which she became one half of the most successful pair the sport has ever seen. “The first two gold medals it was more about volleyball,” she said after stepping down from the podium in London. “The friendship we had was there, but it was volleyball, volleyball, volleyball. This was so much more about the friendship, the togetherness, the journey – and volleyball was just a small part of it.”


Indoor beginnings


The daughter of Butch May, a member of the USA men’s volleyball team at Mexico City 1968, Misty May, as she then was, was introduced to the sport by her parents on the beach in Santa Monica, California. During her childhood years she met some of the greatest names in the sport, among them future triple Olympic champion Karch Kiraly, who sometimes baby‐sat for her.


May went on to become an outstanding indoor volleyball player herself, excelling at school and university and forming part of the Long Beach State 49ers side that recorded 36 consecutive wins in the 1998/99 NCAA Championship season, during which she set a new tournament record for service aces and was named the competition’s most outstanding player.


A record‐breaking partnership


After promptly falling out of love with the indoor game, May decided at the age of 22 to become a professional beach volleyball player. Teaming up with Holly McPeak, she competed in her first Olympics at Sydney 2000, where the pair eventually finished fifth. She then found a new partner in Kerri Walsh. Together they would dominate the domestic and global scene for years to come.


Arriving at Athens 2004 on the back of a 90‐match unbeaten run, the US twosome went on to win the competition without dropping a set, defeating Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil 21‐17, 21‐11 in the gold‐medal match. FIVB world champions in 2003, 2005 and 2007, they had gone 101 matches and 18 tournaments unbeaten by the time Beijing 2008 came around, and completed their Olympic title defence by seeing off No1‐ranked Chinese duo Tian Jia and Wang Jie.


Time‐out and a three‐peat


In between her first two Olympic triumphs, May married the baseball player Matt Treanor, while her partner Walsh took time out after Beijing to have two children with her husband, the volleyball player Casey Jennings. May‐Treanor then ruptured an Achilles tendon on the US TV show Dancing with the Stars, an injury that sidelined her for more than a year.


After failing to reach the heights with interim partner Nicole Branagh in 2010, May‐Treanor was reunited with Walsh‐Jennings the following year, with the pair setting their sights on an unprecedented third Olympic gold. After booking their place at London 2012 with a silver in the worlds in Rome that June, they duly achieved their golden goal, consolidating their place in the history of the sport and bowing out with a series of records that will take some beating.


Now a guest lecturer, brand spokesperson and prominent media figure, May‐Treanor fulfilled another long‐cherished dream in June 2014, giving birth to a daughter.

They qualified for the Olympic Games in 2000 and made it to the final by winning four matches. They settled for silver medals when they lost in the final to local Australians Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst.


A second medal, Olympic history


Four years later, at the Olympic Games in Athens, Adriana and Shelda defeated fellow Brazilians Sandra Pires and Ana Paula in the quarterfinals and Natalie Cook and her new partner Nicole Sanderson in the semi-finals, before falling 17-21, 11-21 to Americans Kerri Walsh and Misty May in the final. The pair Behar/Shelda is the first one to earn more than one medal at the Olympic Games.

After a slow start to their campaign on Rushcutters Bay they put together a consistently good run of performances in the second half of the event to claim a silver medal. Following Sydney the pair went their separate ways and Hiscocks teamed up with Chris Draper.


The duo won the silver medal at the 2002 World Championship and then went one position better to claim the gold in 2003. The Athens Olympics turned into a three way duel between Spain, Ukraine and Great Britain for the gold with the British boat just edged into third place, Hiscocks added a second world title in 2006 but missed out on selection for the Beijing Games. He then began to compete in bigger boats and is a member of the crew of the prospective Spanish America’s Cup team.

A descendant of Danish sailors, Brazil’s Torben Grael honoured his maritime roots at six editions of the Olympic Games, winning five medals.


Sailing DNA


Born in Sao Paulo of Danish descent, Torben Grael hailed from a rich sailing tradition. He was introduced to the water when he was just five, taken under the wing of his grandfather Preben Schmidt - one of the pioneers of Brazilian sailing - and his uncles, Erik and Axel Preben-Schmidt , who represented Brazil at the Olympic Games in 1968 ad 1972. They took him out on Aileen, a 6m class vessel, which had been used at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, by Denmark’s silver medal-winning crew of Herschend, Meulengracht and Thomsen. After his family relocated to Niteroi, opposite Rio de Janeiro in Guanabara Bay, Torben and his younger brother Lars began competing. Together they won the world junior title in the Snipe class in 1978, going on to lift the senior title in the same class in 1983 and 1987. The two brothers competed together for the best part of a decade, before deciding to go their separate ways (Lars would go on to win two Olympic bronze medals in the Snipe class in 1988 and 1996).


Six Games, five medals 


Grael made his Olympic debut at Los Angeles 1984, at the age of 24, when he competed with Ronaldo Senft and Daniel Adler in the Soling class. The trio won silver behind the USA. Four years later in Seoul he was back on Olympic waters, this time in the Star class with Nelson Falcao, and the pair claimed bronze. Grael then began a long partnership with Marcelo Ferreira in the Star. It would eventually develop into a fruitful association, but at Barcelona 1992, they could do no better than 11th place. Then came three successive podium finishes - gold at Atlanta 1996, bronze at Sydney 2000, and gold again at Athens 2004. Grael’s tally of five Olympic medals set a new record, though at London 2012 was equalled by his compatriot Robert Scheidt, and Great Britain’s Ben Ainslie.


Sailor of the Seven Seas


Grael’s uncanny ability to get the most out of his vessel regardless of the weather conditions earned him the nickname of “Turbine”. Away from the Olympic Games, he competed in the Americas Cup on three occasions, either as tactician or a member of the afterguard. In 2000, he was part of the Italian Prada team that challenged Team New Zealand for the trophy, and in 2007 he was part of the Luna Rossa crew that lost the final of the Louis Vuitton Cup - the event to decide the identity of the challenger in the America’s Cup. He twice skippered crews in the the Volvo Ocean Race, navigating Brasil 1 to third place in 2005-2006 before winning the race in 2008-2009. Chosen to carry the flag for the Brazilian team at Athens 2004, Grael was named ISAF World Sailor of the Year in 2009, and, despite hailing from a country where football dominates, he is regarded as one of Brazil’s greatest sporting figures. He once said: “The boat isn’t important, it’s all about the knowledge of the sailor.” Grael certainly had enough to last him a lifetime.

Ross MacDonald first represented Canada at the Olympics in the Star Class in 1988 where, alongside his older brother Bruce, he finished sixth. After teaming up with Eric Jespersen in 1991, Ross gained national fame by capturing a bronze medal in the event at the 1992 Summer Olympics, clinching their podium spot in the final race. They then became internationally known by winning the 1994 Star World Championships by one point. The duo fell to ninth at the 1995 edition, but climbed to sixth in 1996, the same year that they placed fourteenth at the Summer Olympics, following two disqualifications in the initial rounds of the tournament. 


MacDonald and Jespersen split after the Games, but both continued to compete internationally. The former did not attend the 1997 World Championships, but reemerged in 1998 with Kai Bjorn and finished ninth. The duo was two points shy of winning the title in 1999, settling instead for silver. After earning silver again the following year, they attended the 2000 Summer Olympics, but placed fifth. Thereafter, MacDonald and Bjorn chose different partners and the former returned with Mike Wolfs in 2004, coming in 12th and the World Championships. At that year’s Summer Olympics, they were in bronze medal position after the tenth race, behind Marcelo Ferreira and Torben Grael of Brazil and Pascal Rambeau and Xavier Rohart of France, but moved up the podium to silver by finishing second in the final event, while France placed seventh. Outside of competition, MacDonald runs a sailing school and operates North Sails in Vancouver.

Paul Foerster dreamed of going to the Olympics as a boy, but soon realized he was probably not going to make it in basketball, as he had hoped, because of his height of 173 cm (5-8). Foerster started sailing when he began school at the University of Texas, and eventually received All-American honors three times from the ICYRA (later ICSA [Intercollegiate Sailing Association]). He would compete at four Olympics Games in sailing: 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004.


Foerster raced Flying Dutchman boats at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, winning a silver in Barcelona alongside Stephen Bourdow. He switched to 470 Class for his last two Olympics, winning silver with Bob Merrick in 2000 and a gold medal in 2004 with Kevin Burnham . Foerster was on US Sailing teams from 1986 to 2004. Through 2016, Foerster is one of only two US sailors to win three Olympic medals, with Mark Reynolds.


Foerster’s other sailing accomplishments include winning World Championships in Flying Dutchman in 1991 and 1992, winning a 1995 Pan American Games gold medal in J/24 class, and winning a bronze medal in 470 at the 2004 European Championships. He also won the Kiel Week regatta in 470s in 1998.

The winner of seven Olympic medals (five of them gold) and 14 World Championship medals (eight of them gold), China’s Wu Minxia is the most decorated female athlete in the history of diving. As well as collecting four consecutive Olympic 3m synchronised springboard titles between Athens 2004 and Rio 2016 with three different partners, she also won the 3m individual springboard gold at London 2012. 


The quest for individual gold


Wu Minxia’s long and hugely successful Olympic career began at Athens 2004. Partnering Guo Jingjing, she won gold in the 3m women’s synchronised springboard event, a title the duo retained at Beijing 2008, where Guo added another individual 3m springboard title to go with the one she had pocketed in the Greek capital four years earlier.Spotted at a very early age but hampered on her rise to the top by a string of injuries, Wu grew accustomed to being in Guo’s shadow. However, she never gave up hope of fulfilling the dream she had pursued since her childhood, when she would watch on TV as China’s divers soared to success on the Olympic stage, resolving to follow the trail they blazed.After taking individual 3m springboard silver behind Guo in Athens and collecting the bronze in Beijing, when Russia’s Yuliya Pakhalina split the Chinese duo, the ambitious Wu was determined to kick on and finally make that dream a reality.


A long-awaited world title


The turning point in her career came in 2011, a year that began with Guo announcing her retirement after amassing six Olympic medals, four of them gold, a record unrivalled at the time. Together Guo and Wu had also won four 3m synchronised springboard world titles (in 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009), and Wu would win another in Shanghai in 2011 with new partner He Zi. As a sign of things to come, Wu also claimed her one and only world 3m individual title that year, finishing ahead of He in a Chinese one-two.


Coronation in London 


There would be identical outcomes at London 2012, where Wu and He eased to synchronised springboard gold, top-scoring with each of their five dives to rack up a total of 346.20 points and win by a distance from USA’s Kelci Bryant and Abigail Johnston, and the Canadian duo of Jennifer Abel and Emilie Heymans. It was Wu’s third consecutive Olympic gold in the event. Held over three days, Wu dominating proceedings in the preliminary round of the individual 3m springboard competition  The 26-year-old was out in front again in the following day’s semi-finals, and then closed out the competition a day later with five precise dives to win what would be her first and last individual Olympic gold. The only competitor to score in excess of 85 marks – for her third and fifth dives – and to exceed 400 points in total, Wu was a comfortable winner ahead of team-mate He and Mexico’s Laura Sanchez. “I think we all have a dream, and I chose diving, with my aim being to make a difference,” she said at the time. “I never gave up on that dream, though I haven’t achieved this on my own. So many people have supported me, from my family and my coach, to a whole lot of other people behind the scenes.” In winning her sixth Olympic medal, Wu joined the great Guo at the pinnacle of women’s diving, while FINA named her Athlete of the Year in the female diving category in both 2011 and 2012. 


A new partner, more success 


Wu then joined forces with Shi Tingmao in the 3m synchro event, with the pair taking the world title in Barcelona (ESP) in 2013 and retaining it in Kazan (RUS) two years later. In the process, Wu became the first diver in history to win seven world golds in the event, with three different partners. “I’m getting older and it takes longer for me to recover now,” she said after her Kazan triumph. “I need to be efficient when I train and try to avoid picking up injuries. The synchronised was my only event here, and it’s always difficult to win the gold.” 


A matchless record


Wu came close to missing out on Rio 2016 after suffering a leg injury two months before the Games. She made the trip but sat out the individual competition, looking on as her current synchro partner Shi won by a distance from her former partner He. One week later, Wu was back in action alongside Shi to win her fourth consecutive synchronised gold from Italy’s Tania Gagnotto and Francesca Dallapé and Australia’s Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith. In climbing to the top of another Olympic podium, Wu joined her compatriot Chen Ruolin – who won a third consecutive 10m synchro title in Rio – on five diving golds, one more than American great Greg Louganis and her “big sister” Guo. Wu holds the distinctions, however, of being the most decorated Olympic diver in history with seven medals and the oldest woman to win Olympic gold in the sport.


Bowing out


On 22 December 2016, Wu announced her retirement from competitive diving at the age of 31. “Reluctantly, it’s time to call it a day,” she said live on Chinese TV. “The story of Chinese diving didn’t start with me and it won’t end with me. I am really sorry, but my physical condition does not allow me to continue training. I’ve always feared this day coming.” Though maybe not the first or the last great Chinese diver to grace the boards, Wu will no doubt remain the most successful for many years to come.

Guo Jingjing was the fourth diver to win four Olympic gold medals (following Fu Mingxia, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick) and at her retirement, was the female diver with the most Olympic medals (trailing only Dmitry Sautin among men). Uniquely, Guo won her medals on the springboard (3 m) only, while the others also medaled in the platform (10 m). After winning two silver medals in the 2000 Games – together with Fu in the synchronized springboard – Guo doubled in the springboard and synchronized springboard at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, teaming up with Wu Minxia for the synchronized events on both occasions. At World Championships, she displayed a similar superiority. Between 2001 and 2009, she won five consecutive titles in both springboard events.

Diver Thomas Bimis first competed in the Olympic Games in 2000, placing 32nd in the springboard event.


From solo to duo


Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to his hometown of Athens, Bimis teamed with fellow Athenian Nikolaos Siranidis in the synchronized springboard diving event. They had already competed together and won a bronze medal in the Grand Prix in Madrid 2003 and had taken the fifth place of the World Cup event held in Athens in 2004. At the Olympic Games in Athens the contest took place late at night on the third day of competition and Greece had yet to win a gold medal.


The first medal for Greece


Bimis and Siranidis took the early lead, but fell back to fifth place and were still placed only fourth with one dive to go. However, the favourites all blew their final dives, while Bimis and Siranidis, performing inward 3½ somersault tucks, responded to the support of the crowd by hitting their dives with near-perfection. They won the competition by 3.33 points.

György Kolonics is considered the greatest canoeist produced by Hungary, and one of the greatest ever for any nation. He competed in four Olympics (1992-2004), winning two gold and two bronze medals, and was preparing to compete in 2008 when he tragically died while training. Kolonics began his career with the Budapesti Spartacus club but soon moved to Csepel Sportsclub, which he represented for most of his career. He first represented Hungary at the 1991 World Championships, helping them win a gold medal in C-4 1,000 metres. He eventually would win a record (for men) of 15 World Championship gold medals. His greatest achievements were in C-2, teamed with Csaba Horváth. Together they won six World Championships, before Horváth retired in 1998. Kolonics then began to focus on Canadian singles. His World Championship titles were as follows: C-2: 1993 500, 1995 200/500/1,000, 1997 500, 1998 500, 2006 1,000, 2007 500; C-4: 1991 1,000, 1993 1,000, 1994 1,000, 1995 200/500, 1997 500, 1998 500. He won a total of 29 medals at the World Championships. Kolonics was training in Budapest on 15 July 2008 when he collapsed and died from heart failure. It was rumored that he was to be chosen to carry the Hungarian flag at the Beijing Opening Ceremony.

Nathan Baggaley made his international canoeing début for Australia in 1997.  He competed at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, reaching the semi-finals of the K1 500 metres event.  After Sydney, he became one of the top canoeists in the world, winning the World Championship in the K1-500 in 2002 and 2003, in 2003 he also won bronze in K1-1000.  At the Athina Olympics, he was upset by Canada’s Adam van Koeverden and settled for a silver medal.  In 2005 he won his 3rd World Championship in the event, gaining some revenge on van Koeverden who finished third.  Baggaley also won again bronze in the K1-1000 in that year.  Only a few weeks later he tested positive for steroids (stanozolol and methandienone) and was banned from competition for two years.


In February 2007, he was arrested while driving on the Gold Coast, after police found 762 ecstasy tablets in his car.  However, he was arrested for a more serious criminal activity in November 2007, after a police raid followed an investigation into the manufacture and trafficking of MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), the chemical used to make ecstasy.  Baggaley and his brother, Dru, were among those arrested in raids on 10 homes and factories, which yielded more than 28,000 ecstasy tablets and a kilogram of MDMA powder. In May 2009, he pleaded guilty to supplying and manufacturing ecstasy, and faced a prison term of up to 20 years in jail. Baggaley was released from jail in 2011 after serving four years, however, in November 2013, only two years after his release, he was arrested again for drug manufacture, and seven charges including conspiracy to import and manufacture a prohibited drug, and to supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. After another release, in early 2015 he pleaded guilty again to charges of manufacturing methaphetamines.

A lifetime of achievementBy the time she graduated from her army sports boarding school, Fischer was already the youngest champion in the history of Olympic kayaking. She had won gold in the K1 500m at the 1980 Moscow Games aged just 20, setting the tone for her incredible career.


Olympic dominance


Fischer dominated the sport with an amazing run of victories. She won the World Championship in 1981, 1982 and 1983, only missing out at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games due to East Germany’s boycott.


Six Olympic golds


Despite being beaten in the singles final in Seoul in 1998, she won gold in the pairs hours later, and took gold in the fours the next day. She continued with singles gold and fours silver in Barcelona in 1992, then fours gold and pairs silver in Atlanta in 1996. In 2000, in Sydney, Fischer won yet another two golds in the fours and pairs.


Record holder


In Athens in 2004, Birgit came out of retirement for one last performance. Aged 42, she won the gold in the fours (K-4 500m) and silver in the double (K-2 500m). With 12, she is kayaking’s leading medal winner, and only Larissa Latynina (in artistic gymnastics) has won more Olympic medals. Fischer is also the only woman to win Olympic medals 20 years apart.

Italy's Antonio Rossi has won Olympic medals at four consecutive Olympics. Having started canoeing at age 15, he débuted at the Olympics in Barcelona, where he immediately captured a bronze medal in the K-2 500, along with Bruno Dreossi. His most successful Games were in Atlanta, where he won two gold medals, one in the K-1 500m, and one in the K-2 1,000, together with Daniele Scarpa. He retained that last title at the Sydney Olympics, albeit with Beniamino Bonomi. The same duo would win Olympic silver in Athens, with just 0.064 seconds separating them from the gold. Rossi's last Olympic appearance was in Beijing, where he carried the Italian flag during the opening. He now contested the K-4 event, but was unable to win a sixth medal, finishing fourth in the final. Apart from the Olympics, Rossi also starred at World Championships. His best event was the K-2 1,000, winning medals in five consecutive championships. After silver in 1993 and 1994, he won his first title in 1995 (all with Scarpa). This was followed in 1997 and 1998 by two more titles, now with Luca Negri. Rossi also won a silver in the K-4 200 (1998) and a bronze in the K-1 500 (1997). Rossi, who married fellow kayaker Lucia Micheli shortly after his Atlanta wins, was voted on the board of the Italian NOC during his active career. He also became involved in regional politics, and was appointed as councillor for sports in his native province of Lecco in 2009. A devout Catholic, Antonio Rossi was also present at the 2000 Jubilee of sports People, where he addressed the pope and was elected as athlete representative of the Jubilee.

The 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney was, however, a disappointment for Larsen and Fjeldheim, as they placed ninth in K-2 1,000 as their best result. In the 2004 Olympics he first won the K-1 1,000, and an hour later won a bronze medal with Fjeldheim at K-2 1,000. In 2008 he won the silver medal in K-1 1,000 in Beijing. Larsen has been a leading canoeist over the last decade, winning five World, seven European and 21 national titles. He has a masters degree in biomechanics and lives with his wife in Sandvika just outside Oslo. In  2011 he made a comeback after not competing for two seasons.

Canadian born and a competitor for his native country in at the 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympic Games, James “Clay” Ives only won an Olympic medal in luge in 2002, competing for the United States as the doubles partner of Chris Thorpe. He had taken up luging early in his life, after his father could not afford to keep all four of his sons in ice hockey and built a 900 metre sled run. He set off at the age of 17 to join the Canadian National Team and, after competing for nine years with the team, moved to the United States after the 1997-1998 season. Despite once having to go to a food bank to eat, his pleas for extra funding had been ignored by the Canadian Luge Federation. Prior to the Olympics, he won two silver medals (1999 and 2001) in doubles at the North American Luge Championships and decided to retire after the 2002 Winter Games. His childhood sled run is now a tourist attraction at the family-run bed and breakfast and is rented out to groups and, on occasion, the Canadian military.

Anissina initially competed with Iliya Averbukh, winning two junior world titles. After Averbukh left to skate with his girlfriend, Anissina was unable to find a suitable partner in Russia. She finally teamed up with France’s Gwendal Peizerat, moving to Lyon and assuming French citizenship. They gradually worked their way up the ladder, winning their first international medals in 1998 (bronze at the European Championships and Olympics, silver at the World Championships).

Yelena Berezhnaya took up skating at the age of four and switched from singles to pairs at the age of 13. After unsuccessfully teaming up with Aleksandr Ruchkin, her coach’s son, Berezhnaya teamed up with Latvian Oļegs Šļahovs and they skated together more than five years. The partnership went well at first, but soon Šļahovs started to become physically and verbally abusive and showed the first signs of mental instability that later put him in a mental hospital. Due to Šļahovs’ conflicting nature, the pair also trained without a coach for most of their career. Despite that, they finished eighth at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games, were seventh at both the 1994 and 1995 World Championships and fifth at the 1995 European Championships. They also won the 1995 Trophée de France.


But on 9 January 1996, Berezhnaya was seriously injured when Šļahovs' blade sliced into her skull while the pair were practicing a side-by-side camel spin. Two surgical operations were performed to remove bone fragments from her brain and the accident caused partial paralysis on her right side, and doctors were unsure if she would walk again. She also briefly lost the ability to speak.


But Berezhnaya made an unusually quick recovery, being nursed by Anton Sikharulidze, with whom she had became romantically involved a year earlier. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze started training together in November 1996 and soon rose to be one of the top pairs in the World. They won Olympic gold in 2002 and silver in 1998. They were also World Champions in 1998 and 1999, taking silver in 2001. They also won European titles in 1998 and 2001 and a European Championships bronze in 1997. The pair initially won the 2000 European Championships, but were later stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine. She had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required and as a result they were disqualified from sports for three months from the date of the test. The pair also missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification.


After the 2002 Winter Olympics, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze retired from competition and from 2002-06 toured together with Stars on Ice. Berezhnaya married a formed British figure skater Steven Cousins in 2007 and later appeared on numerous Russian ice TV-shows like Star Ice, Ice Age, Kings on Ice and Ice Heart. In 2010 and 2011 she played Queen White in an Alice in Wonderland ice show and in autumn 2011, Berezhnaya participated in the third season of the Canadian reality program Battle of the Blades. She also coached at the Yubileyny rink in Saint Petersburg.

Sikharulidze and Petrova last competed together at the 1996 European Championships, but then parted ways due to coaching disagreements.


In early 1996, Yelena Berezhnaya, with whom Sikharulidze had became romantically involved a year before, had a serious training accident, that left her partially paralyzed, so Sikharulidze moved to Riga, Latvia, where Berezhnaya was hospitalized. Berezhnaya made an unusually quick recovery, and they started training together in November 1996 and soon rose to be one of the top pairs in the World. They won Olympic gold in 2002 and silver in 1998. They were also World Champions in 1998 and 1999, taking silver in 2001.

A member of the United Russia political party, Sikharulidze was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg in 2007. On 2 December 2007, he was also elected to the Russian State Duma (parliament), and became chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for Physical Culture and Sport. In 2010, Sikharulidze ran for the presidency of the Russian Figure Skating Federation, but withdrew after the constitution was altered, stating that the changes left the president as nothing more than a figurehead. In 2011, Sikharulidze married Yana Lebedeva, the daughter of Russian billionaire Leonid Lebedev.

American bobsleigh driver Jill Bakken, who made her debut in the sport at 16, won the first ever Olympic women’s competition at Salt Lake City 2002, in tandem with Vonetta Flowers.


A taste for speed


Born in the US city of Portland, Jill Bakken learned to ski at an early age, and excelled in regional downhill competitions during her teenage years. She was also a talented sprinter and basketball player, but her love of speed saw her gravitate towards bobsleigh, a discipline that was still at the development stage for women and not yet part of the female Olympic winter programme. Having approached the United States Bobsled Federation and expressed her desire to become a driver, Bakken took part in her first race on the Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Run in Lake Placid, becoming, at 16, the youngest driver in the history of the sport.


World Cup debut


Basing herself in Calgary (CAN), where a female bobsleigh programme was developing, Bakken competed in the inaugural women’s two-man bob FIBT World Cup season in 1994. Alongside Jean Racine, another trailblazing American bobsleigh pilot, she achieved impressive results on the circuit. Much to her delight, in 1999 the IOC decided to add bobsleigh to the Olympic programme for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.


The Oregon native subsequently joined the Utah National Guard and entered the US Army World Class Athlete Program, a military unit that supports elite athletes within the army, helping them to prepare for the Olympic Games.


Flowers finds her feet


While Bakken was making gradual progress despite suffering frequent injuries, Vonetta Flowers was also harbouring an Olympic dream, but her hopes were focused on the athletics track. A star long jumper and sprinter at the University of Alabama, she failed to qualify for the Olympic Games in 1996 and 2000. She decided to try her hand at bobsleigh after her husband had seen a flyer encouraging American athletes to try out for the team.


Making history in 2002


On 19 February 2002 at Utah Olympic Park, Flowers and Bakken, who had only joined forces the previous year, got off to a great start in the women’s two-man contest in their red USA-2 bob, recording the fastest first run (48:81, a course record) and setting a new push start record. Ahead of the second run, the duo enjoyed a significant lead of 29/100th of a second over Sandra Prokoff’s Germany-1 team.When USA-2 again clocked the fastest time in the second run, guaranteeing the Americans first place ahead of Germany-1 and Germany-2 (Susi-Lisa Erdmann and Nicole Herschmann), the home crowd erupted with joy. Bakken had become the first female bobsleigh pilot to win an Olympic gold.


“I had a ton of relatives there; it was awesome,” she exclaimed the following day. “I feel like I’m still dreaming. They've supported me through the whole thing – not just this race, but ever since I started sliding. There were tough times, injury-wise, but I never wanted to quit. I wanted to go the Olympic Games, and now I'm here.”


After bringing the curtain down on her sliding career in 2006, Bakken later took up the role of driving coach for the Canadian bobsleigh team, following in the footsteps of her husband, Florian Linder, who now works as a performance analyst for the Russian Bobsleigh Federation.

Vonetta Flowers was a sprinter and long jumper at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She later turned to bobsledding, and at the 2002 Winter Olympics, she was the brakeman for Jill Bakken, as they won the gold medal in the first women’s Olympic bobsled event. In the process, she became the first black athlete to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics. In 2003, she returned to competition with new driver Jean Racine-Prahm. Flowers and Racine-Prahm competed in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, finishing sixth, and together they also won a bronze medal at the 2004 World Championships. After the 2002 Winter Olympics, Flowers gave birth to twins.  One was born deaf and prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics, she took him to Italy to have complex surgery there that was not yet done in the United States. Vonetta Flowers retired from competition after the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Susi Erdmann started her luge career at the age of 9, moving to Oberhof in 1981, and becoming a sport soldier in the former East German Army in 1988. After reunification she was a civil employee at the West German Bundeswehr, before they recruited female soldiers in 1992. She then moved to the sport support group at Berechtesgaden, and in 1997 was the first female professional sanitary soldier employed by the Bundeswehr. After the 1998 Nagano Olympics Erdmann switched to bobsleigh in 2000, later qualifying for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. 


Besides her two Olympic medals Erdmann won her first World Championship in luge in 1989 in the singles, followed by titles in 1991 and 1997. She also won the European Championships in 1990, 1992, 1996 and 1998 and twice was an overall World Cup Winner (1991 and 1992). Additionally she was on the team World Champion four times (1990, 1992, 1993 and 1995). In bobsleigh Erdmann was overall World Cup champion and won the bronze medal at the Olympics in 2002, later winning the World Championship in the two-man bob in 2003 and 2004. Erdmann posed naked for German Playboy in 2004. In another rather esoteric sport, she won the Wok World Championships, which is a funsport competition organized by famous German TV entertainer Stefan Raab, in the four-man wok at Winterberg in 2006, repeating that title in 2008. In November 2007 Erdmann retired, marrying Italian luger Gerhard Plankensteiner in 2009.

Modest startA former decathlete, Langen switched to bobsleigh and started competing as a brakeman in bobsleigh races in 1985. At the 1988 Calgary Winter Games, Langen came seventh in the two-man and 11th in the four-man event.


Gold as driver


Having switched to driver, Langen’s first taste of Olympic success came at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games where he won a bronze medal in the two-man competition. Four years later in Nagano, Langen added another two Olympic medals to his tally by winning the four-man competition and finishing third in the two-man event.


Two-man glory


By 2002, Langen had achieved virtually everything in his sport. With 25 Olympic, World, and European championship medals to his name, the only major victory he had not attained was the Olympic two-man gold. Yet despite his brakeman withdrawing two weeks before the Salt Lake City Winter Games, Langen and his replacement brakeman, Markus Zimmermann, came from behind to win by nine hundredths of a second.


Homemade sleds


Langen actually built his own sleds for competition. He was clearly very good, as it was acknowledged that his sleds were the fastest in the world!

Brakeman Markus Zimmermann started his bobsled career with [Rudi Lochner] winning a totally surprising bronze medal at the 1989 European Championships, although they had not yet been on the German A-Team. They also earned a 1990 German Championship (runner-up one year earlier), a 1992 World Championship, and a silver medal at the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics. Two years later they placed fourth at Lillehammer. After Lochner’s retirement he changed to pilot Christoph Langen’s sled, catching two gold medals in the 1998 Olympic four-man and at the 2002 Winter Olympics in the two-man event, also adding a bronze in the 1998 two-man. At the World Championships they won gold medals in the two-man in 1996 and 2000, two silver medals in 1999 and 2004, two gold medals in the four-man in 1996 and 2001, and two silvers in 1997 and 2000. Their collection was completed by a European Championship in the two-man in 2001, a bronze one year earlier, and two titles in the 1996 and 1999 four-man, adding two bronzes in 1998 and 2004. In 1996, 1998 and 2004 they won the two-man World Cup and in 1999 added the four-man World Cup. Domestically they won five titles. After the season 2003-04 Zimmermann retired, and he then worked as a construction engineer.

Christian Reich took up bobsledding in 1986 and, by 1989, was good enough to win silver in the four-man at the World Championships alongside Donat Acklin and the non-Olympians Nico Baracchi and René Mangold. He first attended the Winter Olympics in 1992, where he was 10th in the two-man with Christian Meili, fifth in the four-man alongside Meili, Bruno Gerber, and Gerold Löffler, and he was seventh in the four-man at the 1994 edition with Löffler, Meili, and René Schmidheiny. In 1995 Reich switched to piloting and, by 1997, was competing at the World Championships once again, where he won a silver medal in the four-man. He was disqualified, however, alongside the first- and third-placing Swiss teams, for competing with a bobsled that the national team had been using all season, unaware that it was illegal. At the 1998 Winter Olympics he was fourth in the two-man with Cédric Grand and seventh in the four-man alongside Grand, Steve Anderhub, and Thomas Handschin, before taking silver in the two-man with Urs Aeberhard at the 1999 European Championships.


Reich’s career really took off in 2000, when he was overall World Cup champion in the two-man and runner-up in the combined. He and Aeberhard also captured bronze in the two- and four-man events at the World Championships, with the assistance of non-Olympians Bruno Aeberhard and Domenic Keller in the latter. In 2001 Reich and Anderhub were runners-up in the two-man at the European Championships and, in 2002, won that title. Reich was also runner-up in the combined and third in the two- and four-man in the World Cup standings that season, but his greatest success came at that year’s Winter Olympics, where he and Anderhub won silver in the two-man. They also came in sixth in the four-man alongside Urs Aeberhard and Guido Acklin. Reich retired from active competition shortly thereafter and worked as head coach of the Monégasque national team until 2006. He was also involved in bobsledding at a technical level, running a business that manufactured sleds (including those used by the Swiss team the 2010 Games), and became Vice President of Corporate and Financial Affairs of the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation in 2010.

Slovakian twin brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner won three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the C-2 canoe double competition between 2000 and 2008. They are determined to make up for the disappointment of London 2012 – where they had to make do with bronze – by adding to their golden haul at Rio 2016.


Canoeing pedigree


Peter and Pavol Hochschorner were born into a family of canoeing enthusiasts in Bratislava (SVK); their father, who is also their coach, and mother had both represented Czechoslovakia in the slalom, while their sister, who works as their manager, has competed in sprint events for Slovakia. In fact, it was in that discipline that the twins initially took to the water, before opting for the intensity of whitewater slaloming. 





“We have never raced with anyone else, so we have built up our own communication,” Peter explained at London 2012. “Most of the time we are just synchronised.”


Glory in Sydney


As they prepared for the final of the Olympic men’s slalom C-2 competition on 20 September 2000 at Penrith Whitewater Stadium near Sydney, Pavol and Peter, both 21, were in a confident mood, having previously been twice crowned European champions (in 1998 and 2000) and having won a silver medal at the 1999 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships.


The brothers proceeded to produce two excellent runs, particularly second time out, where their coordination and fluidity were on full display in a faultless performance. With the two fastest times, they claimed their first Olympic title, finishing comfortably ahead of Krzysztof Kołomański and Michał Staniszewski (POL). 


In the years between Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004, they continued to achieve striking results, amassing victories in several ICF Canoe Slalom World Cups, the 2002 ECA European Championships and the 2002 World Championships.


Gold in Athens and Beijing


On 19 August 2004 at the Hellenikon Olympic Complex to the south of Athens, Pavol and Peter put in a series of marvellous displays, impressing the watching public by posting the fastest times of the preliminary round, semi-final and final. 


Further successes followed in the World Cup, European Championships and World Championships (in 2007 and 2009), and in the 2008 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. In the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, they again emerged from the qualifying round with the best time, but they fell to second position after their semi-final run. On 15 August, however, the Hochschorners surged to a third successive Olympic victory, becoming the first competitors to achieve such a feat in the C-2 category.


London letdown


During the London Games in 2012, the dominant Slovakian pair were taken by surprise by the potency of the challenges provided by the British duos of Timothy Baillie/Etienne Stott and David Florence/Richard Hounslow at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, and were forced to settle for the bronze medal after incurring a two-second penalty for hitting a slalom gate. 


“It was a horrible sensation in London, as we didn’t perform well and we knew that one penalty could cost us a place on the podium,” said Peter. “But in the end, we were happy to have won a medal for Slovakia.”


Focus on Rio


The nine-time European champions and six-time world champions, who boast eight other medals at the Worlds and have topped the overall World Cup standings a record 10 times, will go in search of a fifth Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when they will be 36 years of age. 


“The domestic qualifiers for the Rio Games will be very intense, as we have many talented Slovakian canoeists,” said Pavol. “Once we have guaranteed our place, it would be great to win gold again. There’s a series of young competitors in our category and it will be interesting to face them. We will try to make our experience count.”

Olympic success


Kong made his Olympic debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games. He and his partner Guoliang won gold in the men’s doubles. Four years later, the doubles pair had to settle for silver in Sydney. But Kong stormed into the men’s singles final where he faced table tennis legend Jan-Ove Waldner. 


Epic battle


In the final, Kong promptly won the first two sets. But the veteran Waldner fought back to level the match. In the crucial fifth set, Kong held his nerve to win the game and claim gold. In many ways this moment signalled the passing of the torch from the old master Waldner to the new master Kong.


All-time great


Kong is considered one of the all time greats of table tennis. He is currently the coach of China’s national women’s team.

Throughout his career, Beniamino Bonomi won a lot of silver medals, although eventually won both an Olympic gold medal and a World Championship gold medal. In 1995, Bonomi won the world title in the K2 500 m together with Daniele Scarpa. Favored for the gold in Atlanta, they couple lost the Olympic final by 0.032 seconds, after leading with just 50 m to go. Four years later, Bonomi paired up with Antonio Rossi. Having shaved off his left sideburn for good luck, Bonomi and his partner won the gold by a clear margin this time. In addition to these medals, Bonomi won two more Olympic silvers, 6 silvers at World Championships - 1991 K1 10000 m, 1997 K1 1000 m, 1997 K2 200 m (with Paolo Tommasini), 1997 K2 500 m (with Luca Negri), 1998 K2 500 m (with Luca Negri), 1998 K4 200 m (with Antonio Rossi, Ivano Lussignoli, and Luca Negri), one European title and a host of Italian championships.

Italy's Antonio Rossi has won Olympic medals at four consecutive Olympics. Having started canoeing at age 15, he débuted at the Olympics in Barcelona, where he immediately captured a bronze medal in the K-2 500, along with Bruno Dreossi. His most successful Games were in Atlanta, where he won two gold medals, one in the K-1 500m, and one in the K-2 1,000, together with Daniele Scarpa. He retained that last title at the Sydney Olympics, albeit with Beniamino Bonomi. The same duo would win Olympic silver in Athens, with just 0.064 seconds separating them from the gold. Rossi's last Olympic appearance was in Beijing, where he carried the Italian flag during the opening. He now contested the K-4 event, but was unable to win a sixth medal, finishing fourth in the final. Apart from the Olympics, Rossi also starred at World Championships. His best event was the K-2 1,000, winning medals in five consecutive championships. After silver in 1993 and 1994, he won his first title in 1995 (all with Scarpa). This was followed in 1997 and 1998 by two more titles, now with Luca Negri. Rossi also won a silver in the K-4 200 (1998) and a bronze in the K-1 500 (1997). Rossi, who married fellow kayaker Lucia Micheli shortly after his Atlanta wins, was voted on the board of the Italian NOC during his active career. He also became involved in regional politics, and was appointed as councillor for sports in his native province of Lecco in 2009. A devout Catholic, Antonio Rossi was also present at the 2000 Jubilee of sports People, where he addressed the pope and was elected as athlete representative of the Jubilee.

A lifetime of achievementBy the time she graduated from her army sports boarding school, Fischer was already the youngest champion in the history of Olympic kayaking. She had won gold in the K1 500m at the 1980 Moscow Games aged just 20, setting the tone for her incredible career.


Olympic dominance


Fischer dominated the sport with an amazing run of victories. She won the World Championship in 1981, 1982 and 1983, only missing out at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games due to East Germany’s boycott.


Six Olympic golds


Despite being beaten in the singles final in Seoul in 1998, she won gold in the pairs hours later, and took gold in the fours the next day. She continued with singles gold and fours silver in Barcelona in 1992, then fours gold and pairs silver in Atlanta in 1996. In 2000, in Sydney, Fischer won yet another two golds in the fours and pairs.


Record holder


In Athens in 2004, Birgit came out of retirement for one last performance. Aged 42, she won the gold in the fours (K-4 500m) and silver in the double (K-2 500m). With 12, she is kayaking’s leading medal winner, and only Larissa Latynina (in artistic gymnastics) has won more Olympic medals. Fischer is also the only woman to win Olympic medals 20 years apart.

Katalin Kovács started canoeing with her sisters and first competed for Budapesti Spartacus SC. She won her first medals at the 1993 European Junior Championships with silver in K-2 500 as well as in K-4 500 and became a member of the national team in 1995. In 1996 she was already nominated as a reserve for the Atlanta Olympics and in 1997, after changing to Újpesti TE, won her first medals on the senior level with two silvers at the European Championships as well as one silver at the World Championships. She won her first World title with gold in the 1998 K-4 200 metres. Her first Olympic medals came in 2000 when she won two silver medals. The following years she won nine gold medals at the 2001, 2002, and 2003 World Championships and for the 2004 Olympics she paired with Natasa Janics. This partnership resulted in Kovács' first Olympic gold medal when they won the K-2 500 metres.


At the next two World Championships Kovács and Janics won three gold medals in 2005 and six gold medals in 2006, all in K-2 or K-4 events. At the 2006 European Championships they also won six golds in K-2 and K-4 events, in the 200 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. They did not compete together at the 2007 Worlds – nevertheless Kovács also won two gold and two silver – but paired again for the 2008 Olympics. In Beijing they successfully defended their K-2 500 m title and were also members of the silver medal winning K-4 500 m team. At the following two Worlds Kovács won two K-1 titles in 2009 and, with Janics, two more golds in 2009 and 2010. When Janics took a break in 2011 due to pregnancy, Kovács paired with Danuta Kozák for the Worlds and again won two gold medals. In total Kovács has collected 31 gold, six silver, and three bronze medals at the World Championships and 26 golds and 17 silvers at the European Championships.

At the Olympics, she won back-to-back mixed doubles titles (2000, 2004), both times partnering Zhang Jun. She was only slightly less successful in the women's doubles, finishing third in 2000 (with Qin Yiyuan) and second in 2004 (with Huang Sui), both times losing to a fellow Chinese double. Hoping for a final gold at the home Olympics in Beijing, the second-seeded Ling and her new mix partner Zheng Bo were upset in the first round by the British couple Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson. Gao has also earned four world titles, winning the women's doubles in 2001, 2003 and 2006 (all with Huang), while winning the mixed doubles in 2001 with Zhang. Additionally, she has won four silver and one bronze medals. With the dominant Chinese team, Gao also earned numerous team titles, including five consecutive Uber Cups (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008) and three Sudirman Cups (2001, 2005, 2007). With a total of 11 wins (6 in women's doubles, 5 in mixed), Ling is also one of the most successful female doubles players at the All-England Championships, with only Betty Uber (namegiver of the Uber Cup) having won more. In 2009, she played her last tournament, shortly before getting married.

Guo Jingjing was the fourth diver to win four Olympic gold medals (following Fu Mingxia, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick) and at her retirement, was the female diver with the most Olympic medals (trailing only Dmitry Sautin among men). Uniquely, Guo won her medals on the springboard (3 m) only, while the others also medaled in the platform (10 m). After winning two silver medals in the 2000 Games – together with Fu in the synchronized springboard – Guo doubled in the springboard and synchronized springboard at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, teaming up with Wu Minxia for the synchronized events on both occasions. At World Championships, she displayed a similar superiority. Between 2001 and 2009, she won five consecutive titles in both springboard events.

The first sport practised by Mingxia Fu was gymnastics. At the age of nine, she turned to diving, and in 1991, aged 12, became the youngest world champion in history.


Gold from the age of 14


In 1992, for the Olympic Games in Barcelona, the Chinese youngster was entered for the 10m platform event. Aged barely 14, Mingxia won easily with a score of 461.43 points, almost 50 points ahead of her nearest rival. This gold medal was the first of her impressive Olympic collection.


Doubled in gold


Four years later at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, in 1996, the Olympic champion was entered for two diving events: the platform and the three metres. Mingxia Fu won gold in both. No other woman had ever achieved this since Ingrid Krämer-Engel-Gulbin at the 1960 Games in Rome.


The most decorated diver


At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, synchronised diving events were included on the programme. With her compatriot Jingjing Guo, Mingxia formed an impressive team. Impressive, but not unbeatable, as they were beaten in the three-metres synchronised diving event by the Russian pair, Vera Ilyina and Ioulia Pakhalina. The Chinese duo earned a silver medal for their performance. In the individual three-metre competition, Mingxia Fu and Jingjing Guo were again at the top of the rankings. Mingxia beat her younger compatriot and won her fourth gold medal, bringing her Olympic total to five. This enabled Mingxia to retire from competition as the most successful female diver in Olympic history, ahead even of legends such as Patricia McCormick or Dorothy Poynton Hill.

But after a disastrous performance in Atlanta, she took a post-Olympic break to concentrate on her law studies and she rebuilt her career piece-by-piece in one of the nicest comeback stories in Canadian sport - going on to win two medals at the 2000 Olympic Games (silver in the platform synchro with Emilie Heymans, bronze in the 10m platform).


Montminy started diving at age six, following the example of her father who was a national level diver. She trained at Pointe-Claire Diving Club in Pointe-Claire, Quebec with her long-time coach Yi Hua Li.


A graduate of the University of Montreal and New York University School of Law, Montminy was the recipient of the 1993 Elaine Tanner Award, and was named the 1993 Aquatic Federation of Canada's Female Athlete of the Year.

A golden generationWith 37 medals – 19 of them gold – Romania is among the most successful ever nations in the Olympic rowing events. That success is due in very large measure to four exceptional female rowers:  Elisabeta Lipa, Doina Ignat, Viorica Susanu and Georgeta Andrunache (nee Damian). This quartet dominated their events in the late 1990s and throughout the first decade of the new millennium. Andrunache, the youngest of the four, competed in four editions of the Games between Sydney in 2000 and London 2012, winning five gold medals in the eights and the coxless pairs; together with Lipa, she holds the joint record for the most Olympic titles won by an oarswoman.


Triumph in Sydney


On 23 September 2000 in Penrith, which was the centre for the rowing, kayak and canoe events in Sydney, Damian and Ignat found themselves up against reigning Olympic champions Missy Ryan and Karen Kraft in the final of the women’s coxless pairs. However, the American duo were no match for the Romanians who powered across the line 1.5 seconds ahead of them to claim gold.


Golden hat-trick in the pairs


Damian went on to form a partnership with Viorica Susanu, and together they set a new 2000m world record at the 2002 World Championships with a time of 6.53.80. The duo carried that form into the Olympic Games in Athens two years later. In the coxless pairs final on 14 August 2004 in Schinias, they launched a powerful break at the halfway mark to which the pursuing British, Belarusian, Canadian and German crews had no answer, and the Romanian duo cruised over the line for a clear victory. Damian and Susanu were back to defend their title in Beijing, and on 16 August 2008 achieved another impressive victory by a margin of almost two seconds, this time over China’s Wu You et Gao Yulan. Damian thus joined that elite club of Olympians who have won gold in the same event at three successive editions of the Games. 


Two golds in the eights


Damian was also part of the Romanian eight that won successive World Championship titles in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and was drafted into the crew at Sydney 2000 that successfully defended the Olympic title won by Romania four years earlier in Atlanta, before she was on the team. Ast Athens 2004, they defended their gold in the eights yet again, a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact that Damian and Susanu had only 24 hours to recover after their victory in the coxless pairs. Finally, at Beijing 2008, Damian and her coxless pairs partner were part of the octet that took bronze behind the USA and the Netherlands. 


London swansong


After 20 years competing at the top level, Damian, who is married to fellow rower Valeriu, decided to lay down her oars after Beijing, and took time out to have a second child. However, she was back ahead of London 2012, where she made a bid to win a third gold in the coxless pairs with Susanu. The pair reached the final but could only manage fifth place, at which point she called time on her career for the second and last time.

James Tomkins is the greatest sweep rower ever produced by Australia and his career record matches up well with almost any rower ever.  Between 1986 and 2003, Tomkins won seven gold medals at the World Championships, and he is, through 2008, the only rower to have ever been world champion in all five sweep evenrts.  In 1990, Tomkins joined Nick Green , Sam Patten, and Mike McKay in a coxless four. They were World Champions in 1990-91 and with Andrew Cooper replacing Patten’s seat, they won the gold medal in 1992 at Barcelona. Their success earned the team the nickname “The Oarsome Foursome,” and they repeated their Olympic gold medal performance at the 1996 Olympics, with Drew Ginn replacing Cooper.


Selected for the 2008 Olympics for Australia, and his sixth Olympics, Tomkins through 2004 had won three Olympic golds, and one bronze, in addition to his seven World Championships. At the 1986 Commonwealth Games, he helped the Australian eight to a gold medal, and also won a bronze in the coxed four.  Tomkins has been a winner at The Kings Cup 15 times.

Eastern promiseKathrin Boron was born in the former East German town of Eisenhüttenstatd, on the border with Poland. At the age of eight, she started competing in athletics, and went on to continue his education in a sports school. In 1983, she joined the famous Potsdam rowing club where she progressed under the guidance of coach, Jutta Lau. Three years later, in Roudnice (CZE), she claimed her first international title, as a member of the East German crew that won the quadruple skulls at the 1986 World Rowing Junior Championships, and a year later claimed a second world junior title in the single sculls in Cologne.


From adversity to triumph


Selected to represent the German Democratic Republic at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Boron injured her right ankle and had to withdraw. Once she recovered she swiftly put the setback behind her to win successive golds in the quadruple sculls at the World Rowing Championships in 1989 and 1990, while in 1991 she topped the podium again, this time with a victory in the double sculls with Beate Schramm. By this point she was competing in the colours of a unified Germany. It was in the double sculls –  this time with Kerstin Koeppen –  that she tasted Olympic success for the first time, at Barcelona 1992, competing in the same boat in which she had secured her 1991 world title. 


Gold again in 1996 and 2000


On 27 July 1996 in Atlanta, Boron won another Olympic gold in the quadruple skulls, with Kerstin Koeppen, Katrin Rutschow, and Jana Rau-Sorgers. And four years later in Penrith, the venue for the rowing events at Sydney 2000, she won her third Olympic gold, this time in the double sculls with Jana Thieme.


A new dimension


Bolstered by her three Olympic titles, Boron saw her life change in 2002. As she tells it: “On 5 August, my daughter Cora was born and my life took on a new dimension. In January 2003, feeling a new impetus and sense of motivation, I launched operation ‘Athens 2004’. You know what happened next!”. At the Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre on 22 August 2004, Boron claimed yet another gold in the quadruple sculls along side Meike Evers, Manuela Lutze and Kerstin Kowalski. But she wasn’t finished yet. She still had one more Olympic Games in her, and one more medal. At Beijing 2008, she was a member of the German crew that took bronze in the quadruple sculls, after which she finally confirmed her intention to retire.


Source of inspiration


During 20 years competing at the highest level, Boron amassed a total of five Olympic and 13 world championship medals, making her one of the most successful female rowers in history and a wonderful source of inspiration for the many younger team-mates with whom she shared a boat over the years. In 2009, the international rowing federation, FISA, awarded her its highest honour, the Thomas Keller Medal.

A descendant of Danish sailors, Brazil’s Torben Grael honoured his maritime roots at six editions of the Olympic Games, winning five medals.


Sailing DNA


Born in Sao Paulo of Danish descent, Torben Grael hailed from a rich sailing tradition. He was introduced to the water when he was just five, taken under the wing of his grandfather Preben Schmidt - one of the pioneers of Brazilian sailing - and his uncles, Erik and Axel Preben-Schmidt , who represented Brazil at the Olympic Games in 1968 ad 1972. They took him out on Aileen, a 6m class vessel, which had been used at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, by Denmark’s silver medal-winning crew of Herschend, Meulengracht and Thomsen. After his family relocated to Niteroi, opposite Rio de Janeiro in Guanabara Bay, Torben and his younger brother Lars began competing. Together they won the world junior title in the Snipe class in 1978, going on to lift the senior title in the same class in 1983 and 1987. The two brothers competed together for the best part of a decade, before deciding to go their separate ways (Lars would go on to win two Olympic bronze medals in the Snipe class in 1988 and 1996).


Six Games, five medals 


Grael made his Olympic debut at Los Angeles 1984, at the age of 24, when he competed with Ronaldo Senft and Daniel Adler in the Soling class. The trio won silver behind the USA. Four years later in Seoul he was back on Olympic waters, this time in the Star class with Nelson Falcao, and the pair claimed bronze. Grael then began a long partnership with Marcelo Ferreira in the Star. It would eventually develop into a fruitful association, but at Barcelona 1992, they could do no better than 11th place. Then came three successive podium finishes - gold at Atlanta 1996, bronze at Sydney 2000, and gold again at Athens 2004. Grael’s tally of five Olympic medals set a new record, though at London 2012 was equalled by his compatriot Robert Scheidt, and Great Britain’s Ben Ainslie.


Sailor of the Seven Seas


Grael’s uncanny ability to get the most out of his vessel regardless of the weather conditions earned him the nickname of “Turbine”. Away from the Olympic Games, he competed in the Americas Cup on three occasions, either as tactician or a member of the afterguard. In 2000, he was part of the Italian Prada team that challenged Team New Zealand for the trophy, and in 2007 he was part of the Luna Rossa crew that lost the final of the Louis Vuitton Cup - the event to decide the identity of the challenger in the America’s Cup. He twice skippered crews in the the Volvo Ocean Race, navigating Brasil 1 to third place in 2005-2006 before winning the race in 2008-2009. Chosen to carry the flag for the Brazilian team at Athens 2004, Grael was named ISAF World Sailor of the Year in 2009, and, despite hailing from a country where football dominates, he is regarded as one of Brazil’s greatest sporting figures. He once said: “The boat isn’t important, it’s all about the knowledge of the sailor.” Grael certainly had enough to last him a lifetime.

Three-time Olympic women’s doubles champions, Venus and Serena Williams have each won four golds at the Games. The elder of the two was also the first to complete the singles and doubles ‘double’, at Sydney 2000, a feat her sibling repeated 12 years later. In winning a fifth medal – mixed doubles silver – at Rio 2016, Venus became the most decorated tennis player in Olympic history since 1896.


Sister actOne of five siblings, Venus Williams was born in Lynwood, California, 15 months before her sister and future doubles partner, Serena. Their father Richard was determined that his daughters would be tennis champions and took on the role of coaching them himself from a very young age. Venus and Serena were both quick to develop their physical strength (Venus was already producing serves in excess of 160 km/h by the age of 10), winning numerous tournaments across the USA as they progressed through the age categories. Venus turned professional when she was just 14. Three years later, in 1997, she became the first unseeded player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam final, at the US Open, only to be outclassed by Switzerland’s Martina Hingis.First Olympic titlesIt was Serena who kickstarted the Williams sisters’ era of Grand Slam domination, claiming the US Open title in 1999. The following year, Venus won the first of her own Grand Slam titles, triumphing at Wimbledon and then the US Open, defeating fellow American Lindsay Davenport on both occasions. Straight after her victory in New York, she headed for Sydney, where she powered past Russia’s Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-4 to win Olympic gold in the women’s singles final. The following day she teamed up with Serena for the women’s doubles final, with the sisters taking just 49 minutes to dispatch Dutch pair Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans 6-1, 6-1. In the process, Venus became the first woman to win the singles and doubles at the same Games since Helen Wills Moody in 1924. It was the start of the Williams sisters’ longstanding love affair with the Olympic doubles tournament. Speaking after that first win, Venus said: “For me, this is almost bigger than singles. To have a victory like this with Serena, my sister, a member of my family and my best friend, doesn't happen often. It's very rare. Just to be able to play and win together at this level is really huge.” Winning together was something the sisters would go on to do on many occasions in the years that followed. Williams vs Williams In 2001, Venus and Serena became the first sisters to contest a major tournament final when they faced off at the US Open. On that occasion it was the elder sibling who came out on top. In February 2002, Venus was confirmed as world No1, going on to face, and lose against, her sister in a remarkable series of four consecutive Grand Slam finals (from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian). Meanwhile, Venus, whose career was later disrupted by a series of injuries, made Wimbledon her own, winning the event a total of five times. The last of those victories came against Serena in 2008, with the two then joining forces on Centre Court to land a record 14th Grand Slam doubles title.Olympic treble An injury to Serena in August 2004 forced the sisters to withdraw from the women’s doubles in Athens, though they were on top again in 2008 and 2012. In Beijing, they overcame Spain’s Anabel Medina and Virginia Ruano 6-2, 6-0, and on the Wimbledon grass four years later they swept aside Czech duo Andrea Hlavacova and Lucie Hradeck 6-4, 6-4, with Venus securing the gold with a sumptuous backhand volley. “Crazy,” said Serena, who had won the singles final the previous day. “I'm always copying her. I forgot that she did it in Sydney and I do it here. We're the same doubles team, we just split this to singles, so it's cool.”Silver lining in Rio Venus remained a fixture on the WTA Tour in the years that followed. Though major singles titles were no longer coming her way, she did win a sixth Wimbledon women’s doubles title with her sister in 2016, taking to 14 their unbeaten run in Grand Slam finals since 1999. Their proud record of winning every Olympic women’s doubles competition they entered ended at Rio 2016, where they lost 6-3, 6-4 in the first round to Czech pair Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova. Venus tumbled out of the singles at the same stage, beaten in three sets by Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens. She gave herself a chance of becoming the first tennis player – male or female – of all time to win five Olympic golds by reaching the mixed doubles final with Rajeev Ram. It was not to be, however, as their compatriots Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock edged them out 10-7 in the final set. That silver was nevertheless an historic one: it made Venus the most decorated of Olympic tennis player of them all.

A professional tennis player for 13 years, Miriam Oremans never won a WTA singles tournament, despite playing five finals. She twice reached the final at Rosmalen (1997, 1998), near her home town Berlicum, but lost both matches. She was more successful in doubles play, winning titles in Linz (1992), Rosmalen (1998) and Paris (1999), partnering Belgium's Sabine Appelmans in the latter two tournaments. In mixed doubles, she reached the 1992 Wimbledon final with Jacco Eltingh but lost to Neiland/Suk. In 1997, she lead the Dutch team to the Fed Cup final, which they lost 1-4 in front of a home crowd. Playing with Kristie Boogert at the Sydney Olympics, Oremans reached the doubles final, facing Venus and Serena Williams. The Dutch duo had no illusions about the final, and were happy with their silver medal following a 6-1, 6-1 defeat at the hands of the Williams sisters.

Jan Behrendt and Stefan Krauße formed a redoubtable doubles luge team, competing first for the German Democratic Republic and after 1992 for Germany. At the Olympics, they won gold medals in 1992 and 1998, silver in 1988, and bronze in 1994. Behrendt and Krauße began to compete together internationally at the 1985 European Junior championships. Together, they won four World Championships – 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995; and were runners-up in 1996-97. They were also World Cup champions in 1994-96 and European champions in 1996. They announced their retirement after the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Friends since the age of six, Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt grew up in Ilmenau, the hometown of both 1988 luge individual gold medalist Jens Mueller.  Krausse and Behrendt themselves took home silver medals in the double-seater event in 1988, trailing East German teammates Jörg Hoffmann and Jochen Pietzsch by a tenth of a second.  At the 1992 Albertville Olympics, Krausse and Behrendt moved up the platform to the gold medal stand.  Two years later in the Lillehammer Games, they completed their set of medals by placing third.  By the time of the 1998 Nagano Olympics, Krausse and Behrendt were 31 years old.  This time they took a lead of 42 one-thousandths of a second on the first run and withstood the challenge of Americans Chris Thorpe and Gordon Sheer to hold on for the victory.  They are the only double-seater sliders to earn medals in four Olympics.

After the 1992 Winter Olympics, Mishkutyonok and Dmitriyev turned professional and won a bronze at the 1993 World Professional Championships, but when a new ISU rule allowed professional skaters to regain their Olympic eligibility, the pair returned to amateur competition for the 1993-94 season and skated at the Winter Olympics, where they won silver behind Gordeyeva and Grinkov, who had also returned to amateur competition. Mishkutyonok and Dmitriyev also won a bronze at the 1994 European Championships. They never won a Soviet or Russian title, but were runners-up at the 1990 and 1991 Soviet and 1994 Russian Championships. After the 1994 Winter Olympics, Mishkutenok retired and Dmitriev found a new partner, Oksana Kazakova. The pair won the 1996 European Championships, silver at the 1998 European Chamopionships and bronze at the 1997 World Championships, also winning gold at the 1998 Winter Olympics, which made Dmitriev the first male skater to win the pairs event twice with different partners.

Yelena Berezhnaya took up skating at the age of four and switched from singles to pairs at the age of 13. After unsuccessfully teaming up with Aleksandr Ruchkin, her coach’s son, Berezhnaya teamed up with Latvian Oļegs Šļahovs and they skated together more than five years. The partnership went well at first, but soon Šļahovs started to become physically and verbally abusive and showed the first signs of mental instability that later put him in a mental hospital. Due to Šļahovs’ conflicting nature, the pair also trained without a coach for most of their career. Despite that, they finished eighth at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games, were seventh at both the 1994 and 1995 World Championships and fifth at the 1995 European Championships. They also won the 1995 Trophée de France.


But on 9 January 1996, Berezhnaya was seriously injured when Šļahovs' blade sliced into her skull while the pair were practicing a side-by-side camel spin. Two surgical operations were performed to remove bone fragments from her brain and the accident caused partial paralysis on her right side, and doctors were unsure if she would walk again. She also briefly lost the ability to speak.


But Berezhnaya made an unusually quick recovery, being nursed by Anton Sikharulidze, with whom she had became romantically involved a year earlier. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze started training together in November 1996 and soon rose to be one of the top pairs in the World. They won Olympic gold in 2002 and silver in 1998. They were also World Champions in 1998 and 1999, taking silver in 2001. They also won European titles in 1998 and 2001 and a European Championships bronze in 1997. The pair initially won the 2000 European Championships, but were later stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine. She had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required and as a result they were disqualified from sports for three months from the date of the test. The pair also missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification.


After the 2002 Winter Olympics, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze retired from competition and from 2002-06 toured together with Stars on Ice. Berezhnaya married a formed British figure skater Steven Cousins in 2007 and later appeared on numerous Russian ice TV-shows like Star Ice, Ice Age, Kings on Ice and Ice Heart. In 2010 and 2011 she played Queen White in an Alice in Wonderland ice show and in autumn 2011, Berezhnaya participated in the third season of the Canadian reality program Battle of the Blades. She also coached at the Yubileyny rink in Saint Petersburg.

Born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) to a Georgian family, Anton Sikharulidze took up skating at the age of 5 and took up pairs skating at the age of 15. His first partner was Mariya Petrova and together they became World Junior Champions in 1994 and 1995. Sikharulidze and Petrova last competed together at the 1996 European Championships, but then parted ways due to coaching disagreements.


In early 1996, Yelena Berezhnaya, with whom Sikharulidze had became romantically involved a year before, had a serious training accident, that left her partially paralyzed, so Sikharulidze moved to Riga, Latvia, where Berezhnaya was hospitalized. Berezhnaya made an unusually quick recovery, and they started training together in November 1996 and soon rose to be one of the top pairs in the World. They won Olympic gold in 2002 and silver in 1998. They were also World Champions in 1998 and 1999, taking silver in 2001.

In 2007, Sikharulidze entered politics, although he later made occasional appearances at some Russian ice TV shows like Ice Age. A member of the United Russia political party, Sikharulidze was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg in 2007. On 2 December 2007, he was also elected to the Russian State Duma (parliament), and became chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for Physical Culture and Sport. In 2010, Sikharulidze ran for the presidency of the Russian Figure Skating Federation, but withdrew after the constitution was altered, stating that the changes left the president as nothing more than a figurehead. In 2011, Sikharulidze married Yana Lebedeva, the daughter of Russian billionaire Leonid Lebedev.

Steuer and Wötzel won the bronze medal in 1998 at Nagano, and won the 1997 World Championships, after having been runners-up in 1996.

After his retirement from skating, Steuer began a coaching career, mainly with pairs skaters, based in Chemnitz. His best known students have been four-time World Champions Aljona Sawtchenko and Robin Szolkowy. But Steuer has been a controversial figure in Germany because he has been found to have been a former Stasi informant in the old GDR. He has been denied German accreditation, excluded from the German team, and not allowed to wear German team uniforms at some events, and this has led to several lawsuits on Steuer's part, several of which he has won.

Pasha Grishchuk was born in Odessa, Ukraine and took up skating at the age of four. Raised by a single mom, she and her mother moved to Moscow in 1980, where she began to skate with Aleksandr Chichkov. Together they won the World Junior ice dance title in 1988, while taking silver at the 1987 World Junior Championships. They also won the Soviet title in 1988 and that would have been a great start to a successful career, if Chichkov had not retired from sports in the summer of 1989 due to an injury. After Chichkov’s retirement, Grishchuk partnered with Yevgeny Platov and together they became the world’s best ice dancers during the 90s. The pair made their international début in 1990, placing fifth at both the World and European Championships and next year they were fourth at the Worlds and fifth at the Europeans. Their first podium success came in 1992, when they won bronzes at both the World and European Championships, which they bettered to silvers in next year. Grishchuk and Platov were the Olympic champions in 1994 and 1998, World Champions in 1994-97 and European champions in 1996-98, while taking silver at the 1994 European Championships. They also won the Soviet title in 1991 and Russian titles in 1993 and 1996.


Grishchuk and Platov retired from amateur competition after the 1998 Winter Olympics and later skated together in shows until summer of 1998, when Platov decided to skate with their former rival Maiya Usova and Grishchuk then skated with Sasha Zhulin, with whom she skated for a year. Grishchuk later worked as a figure skating coach at the KHS Arena in Anaheim, California.

Yevgeny Platov started to skate when he was 7-years-old and at the junior level skated with Yelena Krykanova, with whom he won the World Junior ice dancing titles in 1984-86. As a senior, Platov at first skated with Larisa Fedorinova and they were sixth at the 1989 World Championships, but then Fedorinova retired from sports and Platov teamed up with Pasha Grishchuk, together becoming the world’s best ice dancers during the 90s. The pair made their international début in 1990, placing fifth at both the World and European Championships and next year they were fourth at the Worlds and fifth at the Europeans. Their first podium success came in 1992, when they won bronzes at both the World and European Championships, which they bettered to silvers in next year. Grishchuk and Platov were the Olympic champions in 1994 and 1998, World Champions in 1994-97 and European Champions in 1996-98, while taking silver at the 1994 European Championships. They also won the Soviet title in 1991 and Russian titles in 1993 and 1996.


Grishchuk and Platov retired from amateur competition after the 1998 Winter Olympics and later skated together in shows until summer of 1998, when Platov decided to skate with their former rival Maiya Usova, while Grishchuk skated with Sasha Zhulin. From 2002-04 Platov coached with Usova at the International Skating Center of Connecticut in Simsbury, Connecticut, where they helped coach the 2006 Olympic champion Shizuka Arakawa to her only world title in 2004. In 2005, Platov became the assistant coach to his former rival, Zhulin, helping to coach the ice dancing team of Tatyana Navka and Roman Kostomarov to European and Olympic gold medals. Platov started coaching on his own in 2007, at first at the Princeton Sports Center in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey and since 2009 at the Igloo Ice Rink in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.

Born into a musical family, her grandparents and father being musicians and her niece a ballerina, Anzhelika Krylova was considered as a highly talented ice dancer in her youth, but a back injury sustained early in her career never let her achieve her full potential. In her early career, Krylova skated with Vladimir Lelyukh and Vladimir Fyodorov. With Fyodorov, she won the bronze medal at the 1993 World Championships and was sixth at the 1994 Winter Olympics, but their partnership was short-lived.


In mid-94, Krylova teamed up with Oleg Ovsyannikov and together they became one of the top ice dance couples in the late 1990s, overshadowed only by Pasha Grishchuk and Yevgeny Platov. Krylova/Ovsyannikov won Olympic silver in 1998 (behind Grishchuk and Platov), were World Champions in 1998 and 1999 (Grishchuk and Platov were absent), European Champions in 1999, won silvers at the 1996 and 1997 World and 1996-98 European Championships (behind Grishchuk and Platov) and a bronze at the 1995 European Championships.


Krylova and Ovsyannikov were also planning to compete in 2000 and had prepared programs and costumes, however, doctors advised her to retire due to a risk of paralysis stemming from her back problem. So they turned to the much less demanding and more remunerative professional skating. They won the 2001 World Professional Championships together, but the continuing back problems forced her to retire from sports soon after that. In 2004, Krylova married former Italian figure skater Pasquale Camerlengo and she has worked as a figure skating coach and choreographer alongside her husband, at first in Berlin, Germany and since 2006 in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

Like his brothers, Günther Huber began his career as a luger with his best result being a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in his specialty, doubles in 1982. He switched to bobsledding as a pilot in 1988 , stating he was ""tired of losing against the brothers."" In this new discipline he achieved all his best results. He participated in four consecutive Winter Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the two-man bobsled together with Stefano Ticci in 1994. At the same Olympics, his brothers Wilfried and Norbert also took home medals, while Arnold had to settle for fourth place. At Nagano in 1998 Günther Huber won gold in the two-man with brakeman Antonio Tartaglia, tied with the Canadian crew of Pierre Lueders.


During his career Huber won two medals at World Championships, both in the two-man, a silver medal in 1997 with Tartaglia and the gold medal in 1999. This success came after a disastrous period, which started four months prior with the theft of his bob, continued with injuries to his long-time partner Tartaglia and substitute Massimiliano Rota, and ultimately ended with another injury to replacement Enrico Costa, who had to be replaced by Ubaldo Ranzi. In the World Cup Huber made the podium for the first time in the 1991-92 season with a third place in St. Moritz in the two-man and in the same event he achieved his first World Cup victory in the following season in Lillehammer. In the overall standings he won the trophy in his specialty, the two-man, in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons, while in 1996-97 he won the combined World Cup. At the European Championships Huber won another six medals, two of them gold, one each in the two-man and four-man event. Between 1991 and 2001 he won seven national titles in the two-man and one in the four-man bob.


Huber was a member of the Carabinieri, the national military police of Italy, and became bobsled coach for the Italian national team in 2008. He was awarded the Bronze Cross of Merit of the Army twice (1994, 1999) and the Gold Cross of Merit in 1998.

Coming from athletics, especially the shot put and discus, Antonio Tartaglia tried bobsledding successfully after he joined the Carabinieri, the Italian national military police, and he would participate in four Winter Olympics. His outstanding achievement was the gold medal in two-man bobsled in 1998 at Nagano as brakeman for pilot Günther Huber, tied with the Canadian crew of Pierre Lueders. Nine years later Tartaglia won the silver medal at the 2007 World Championships again in the two-man with Huber. At the European Championships, Tartaglia won three medals, including two gold medals, one each in the four- and two-man, in 1994 and 1997, respectively. In addition he won seven Italian Championships, five in the two-man bob between 1992-2000 and another two in 2001, winning both events that year. After his active career, he was a technician for many years for the Italian team and later became fitness coach of the Italian men’s national bobsled team.

The most decorated bobsledder in Canadian history, Pierre Leuders competed for Canada as early as 1990 and appeared at five Winter Olympics from 1994 through 2010. His list of international medals is long: two gold, four silver and two bronze medals at the World Bobsled Championships (five in two-man competitions and three in four-man) from 1995 through 2007, in addition to the gold he won in the two-man event at the 1998 Winter Olympics (shared with Italy) and the silver in at the 2006 Games. He has also won the combined men's event four times, the two-man six times (the only man in World Cup history to achieve this) and the four-man once at the World Cup. Bobsled, however, was not Leuders' first athletic choice and trained to be a decathlete until 1989. He turned down an offer to carry the Canadian Flag at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympics, preferring to focus on training and preparation for the competitions. One of the turns at the Whistler Sliding Center, a venue for bobsled, luge and skeleton at the 2010 Olympics, is named ""Lueders Loop"" in his honor. After finishing fifth in both the two-man and four-man events at the 2010 Games, he retired from the sport and was named coach of the Canadian national bobsleigh team.

Modest startA former decathlete, Langen switched to bobsleigh and started competing as a brakeman in bobsleigh races in 1985. At the 1988 Calgary Winter Games, Langen came seventh in the two-man and 11th in the four-man event.


Gold as driver


Having switched to driver, Langen’s first taste of Olympic success came at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games where he won a bronze medal in the two-man competition. Four years later in Nagano, Langen added another two Olympic medals to his tally by winning the four-man competition and finishing third in the two-man event.


Two-man glory


By 2002, Langen had achieved virtually everything in his sport. With 25 Olympic, World, and European championship medals to his name, the only major victory he had not attained was the Olympic two-man gold. Yet despite his brakeman withdrawing two weeks before the Salt Lake City Winter Games, Langen and his replacement brakeman, Markus Zimmermann, came from behind to win by nine hundredths of a second.


Homemade sleds


Langen actually built his own sleds for competition. He was clearly very good, as it was acknowledged that his sleds were the fastest in the world!

The current coach of the 2014 World Championship-winning USA women’s team, Charles “Karch”Kiraly won three Olympic gold medals, spanning both volleyball and beach volleyball, and was named player of the 20th century.


College star


Charles Frederick Kiraly grew up in Santa Barbara, California. Before emigrating to the USA, his father Laszlo was a member of the Hungarian junior national volleyball team and instilled a passion for the sport in his young son on the beaches of California. After consistently shining on his high school side in Santa Barbara, “Karch”, as he was known, enrolled at UCLA, where he majored in biochemistry and debuted for both the UCLA Bruins in the NCAA Championship and the USA youth side. With the Bruins, Kiraly won titles in 1979, 1981 and 1983, going unbeaten in two full seasons and falling to just five defeats in total. He was named the NCAA’s outstanding player in 1981 and 1982 and earned All-American honours on four occasions, playing for a side made up of the best college volleyball players.


Double Olympic gold


An attacking serve receiver and an excellent passer, Kiraly went on to become the greatest volleyball player in America, and then the world. He moved up to the senior national team in 1981 and continued to impress in a side that won the gold medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Games with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in the final. After taking over the national team captaincy, Kiraly led his side to victory in the 1985 World Cup and then the 1986 World Championships in France to seal an exceptional “triple crown”. Later that year, he was named as the best player in the world by the FIVB for the first time. At the Seoul Games in 1988, meanwhile, the USA won every one of their matches, culminating in a 3-1 win over the USSR in the final. Kiraly was named as the tournament’s best player before once again being named as the greatest player in the world at the end of the year.


Hitting the beach


After initially continuing his professional career in the Italian Championship with Il Messaggero Ravenna, where he won a series of titles including the national championship in 1991 and the CEV Champions League and European Supercup in 1992, Kiraly turned his attention to beach volleyball full-time in 1993. The player continued to find success and, when the IOC added beach volleyball to the programme for the Atlanta Games, Kiraly won his third Olympic title alongside Kent Steffes on 28 July 1996 after sealing a 2-0 victory over American pairing Michael Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh. As well as winning the first ever Olympic beach volleyball gold medal, Kiraly remains the only player to have won gold in both versions of the sport.


Champion coach


In 2001, the FIVB named Kiraly and Cuban middle blocker Regla Torres as the greatest players of the 20th century. He continued to dominate global beach volleyball tournaments until 2007, eventually retiring from the sport at the age of 47 before quickly making the transition to a coaching role for the national team. Kiraly, whose surname fittingly means “King” in Hungarian, was assistant coach of the USA women’s volleyball team that took silver at the 2012 London Games before later taking over as head coach with a view to achieving success in the 2016 Games in Rio.


In October 2014, Kiraly’s USA women’s side claimed their first ever world championship title after beating China 3-1 in the final in Milan. “We came here to make history and that’s what we’vedone,” he enthused.

Mike Whitmarsh excelled at both volleyball and basketball, but was one of the rare beach volleyballers who did not grow up playing the sport. He first attended college at Grossmont College and later at the University of San Diego, where he starred on the basketball team, majoring in political science with a minor in business. Whitmarsh was drafted in the fifth round of the NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blaxers in 1984, although he never played in the NBA. He did play professional basketball in Germany for three years. On his return to the States he turned to beach volleyball and made the inaugural US Olympic team in that sport in 1996. He was a leader on the new AVP tour and won 28 pro tournaments in beach volleyball, and slightly over $1.6 million in his career in that sport. He won titles with five different partners, but most of them (16) with Mike Dodd, with whom he won the silver medal in Atlanta. Whitmarsh was AVP Rookie-of-the-Year in 1990, in 2003 was awarded the AVP Special Achievement and Role Model Awards, and in 2004 was given their Lifetime Achievement Award. Whitmarsh committed suicide in a friend's house by inhaling carbon monoxide from a car exhaust.

He did not reach the podium at any event, however, until teaming up with Mark Heese for the 1995 season, which the duo completed with a ranking of 11th. They had their first win in 1996 and, later that month, attended the Summer Olympics, where beach volleyball was being contested for the first time. After reaching the quarter-finals, Heese and Child bested Javier Bosma and Sixto Jiménez of Spain and advanced to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by eventual gold medalists Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes of the United States. The Canadians then won the bronze medal match against Miguel Maia and João Brenha of Portugal, giving Canada, as of 2012, its only medal in the sport.


Child and Heese were ranked 15th overall over the next three seasons and returned to compete for Canada at the 2000 Summer Olympics, where they were eliminated in the eighth-finals by Zé Marco and Ricardo of Brazil, the upcoming silver medalists, and finished joint-fifth overall. They had the same result at the 2004 edition, after being defeated by Bosma and Pablo Herrera of Spain, the eventual runners-up, in the quarter-finals. After the Games, Child played in only three more international events prior to his 2006 retirement and has since worked as a coach for the sport in his native Ontario.

A lifetime of achievementBy the time she graduated from her army sports boarding school, Fischer was already the youngest champion in the history of Olympic kayaking. She had won gold in the K1 500m at the 1980 Moscow Games aged just 20, setting the tone for her incredible career.


Olympic dominance


Fischer dominated the sport with an amazing run of victories. She won the World Championship in 1981, 1982 and 1983, only missing out at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games due to East Germany’s boycott.


Six Olympic golds


Despite being beaten in the singles final in Seoul in 1998, she won gold in the pairs hours later, and took gold in the fours the next day. She continued with singles gold and fours silver in Barcelona in 1992, then fours gold and pairs silver in Atlanta in 1996. In 2000, in Sydney, Fischer won yet another two golds in the fours and pairs.


Record holder


In Athens in 2004, Birgit came out of retirement for one last performance. Aged 42, she won the gold in the fours (K-4 500m) and silver in the double (K-2 500m). With 12, she is kayaking’s leading medal winner, and only Larissa Latynina (in artistic gymnastics) has won more Olympic medals. Fischer is also the only woman to win Olympic medals 20 years apart.

Throughout his career, Beniamino Bonomi won a lot of silver medals, although eventually won both an Olympic gold medal and a World Championship gold medal. In 1995, Bonomi won the world title in the K2 500 m together with Daniele Scarpa. Favored for the gold in Atlanta, they couple lost the Olympic final by 0.032 seconds, after leading with just 50 m to go. Four years later, Bonomi paired up with Antonio Rossi. Having shaved off his left sideburn for good luck, Bonomi and his partner won the gold by a clear margin this time. In addition to these medals, Bonomi won two more Olympic silvers, 6 silvers at World Championships - 1991 K1 10000 m, 1997 K1 1000 m, 1997 K2 200 m (with Paolo Tommasini), 1997 K2 500 m (with Luca Negri), 1998 K2 500 m (with Luca Negri), 1998 K4 200 m (with Antonio Rossi, Ivano Lussignoli, and Luca Negri), one European title and a host of Italian championships.

György Kolonics is considered the greatest canoeist produced by Hungary, and one of the greatest ever for any nation. He competed in four Olympics (1992-2004), winning two gold and two bronze medals, and was preparing to compete in 2008 when he tragically died while training. Kolonics began his career with the Budapesti Spartacus club but soon moved to Csepel Sportsclub, which he represented for most of his career. He first represented Hungary at the 1991 World Championships, helping them win a gold medal in C-4 1,000 metres. He eventually would win a record (for men) of 15 World Championship gold medals. His greatest achievements were in C-2, teamed with Csaba Horváth. Together they won six World Championships, before Horváth retired in 1998. Kolonics then began to focus on Canadian singles. His World Championship titles were as follows: C-2: 1993 500, 1995 200/500/1,000, 1997 500, 1998 500, 2006 1,000, 2007 500; C-4: 1991 1,000, 1993 1,000, 1994 1,000, 1995 200/500, 1997 500, 1998 500. He won a total of 29 medals at the World Championships. Kolonics was training in Budapest on 15 July 2008 when he collapsed and died from heart failure. It was rumored that he was to be chosen to carry the Hungarian flag at the Beijing Opening Ceremony.

Soviets Nikolae Juravschi and Victor Reneischi were the best canoeing pair at the end of the 1980s and start of the 1990s. At their first international tournament, the 1988 Olympics, Juravschi and Reneischi won golds in both C-2 500 and C-2 1,000. They together also won eight World titles (in 1989-90 in C-2 500, in 1989-91 in C-4 500 and 1989-91 in C4 1,000), two World Championships silvers (in 1991 and 1995 in C-2 500) and one bronze (in 1991 in C-2 1,000). Despite those successes, the pair was not selected for the 1992 Olympics by the Unified Team. Instead, Juravschi was invited to the Romanian 1992 Olympic team, and with new partner Gheorghe Andriev reached the finals of both the C-2 500 and C-2 1,000, finishing in the unfortunate fourth position in both races. After the 1992 Olympics and the fall of Soviet Union, the pair fell apart, as Juravschi started to represent his native Moldova and Reneischi returned to his native Belarus. They were not very successful after separating, so in 1995, Juravschi persuaded his former partner to join up again and represent his home country Moldova. Their comeback was successful, as they won silver in the C-2 500 metres at the 1995 World Championships and repeated that feat at the 1996 Olympics, where they won the first ever Olympic medal for the newly independent Moldova. After the 1996 Olympics, Juravschi retired from sports and has worked as the president of Moldovan Canoe-Kayak Federation. Since 2001, he has also been the president of the Moldovan Olympic Committee.

He did so with his long-time partner, Gheorghe Andriev, with whom he also competed in the Seoul and Atlanta Olympics. At the latter occasion, the duo grabbed a bronze in the 500 m event, having made the final in the 500 m and 1000 m in 1988. After the end of his active career, Obreja migrated to France, where he coached at AS Mantaise in Mantes-la-Jolie. He also worked as a sports director for the town of Buchelay.

Italy's Antonio Rossi has won Olympic medals at four consecutive Olympics. Having started canoeing at age 15, he débuted at the Olympics in Barcelona, where he immediately captured a bronze medal in the K-2 500, along with Bruno Dreossi. His most successful Games were in Atlanta, where he won two gold medals, one in the K-1 500m, and one in the K-2 1,000, together with Daniele Scarpa. He retained that last title at the Sydney Olympics, albeit with Beniamino Bonomi. The same duo would win Olympic silver in Athens, with just 0.064 seconds separating them from the gold. Rossi's last Olympic appearance was in Beijing, where he carried the Italian flag during the opening. He now contested the K-4 event, but was unable to win a sixth medal, finishing fourth in the final. Apart from the Olympics, Rossi also starred at World Championships. His best event was the K-2 1,000, winning medals in five consecutive championships. After silver in 1993 and 1994, he won his first title in 1995 (all with Scarpa). This was followed in 1997 and 1998 by two more titles, now with Luca Negri. Rossi also won a silver in the K-4 200 (1998) and a bronze in the K-1 500 (1997). Rossi, who married fellow kayaker Lucia Micheli shortly after his Atlanta wins, was voted on the board of the Italian NOC during his active career. He also became involved in regional politics, and was appointed as councillor for sports in his native province of Lecco in 2009. A devout Catholic, Antonio Rossi was also present at the 2000 Jubilee of sports People, where he addressed the pope and was elected as athlete representative of the Jubilee.

A junior world champion in 1987, Wilfrid Forgues went on to forge a hugely successful partnership with Franck Adisson that saw them regularly win medals in the Canadian pairs slalom category in the years that straddled the 20th and 21st centuries. 


Forgues and Adisson were ten times champions of France and four times World Championship gold medallist but the highlight of their career came with victory at the Ocoee Whitewater Center during the 1996 Summer Olympics. The duo had already won bronze at Barcelona and would return to compete, without medal success, at the Sydney Games.


Retiring shortly after the 2000 Olympics he set up his own computer company and later accepted the post of President of his region’s canoe federation.In 2016, by then married and the father of two teenaged children, Forgues decided to reveal his struggle with gender identity to his family, separated with his wife and began to live his life as a woman. Two years later he revealed to the newspaper L'Équipe that he had begun to take female hormones and was due to undergo gender reassignment surgery in Spring 2019.

Steven redgrave is widely considered to be the greatest rower of all time, winning gold medals at five successive editions of the olympic games.


FIRST GOLD MEDAL


The extraordinary tally of Redgrave’s Olympic medals started in Los Angeles in 1984. With Martin Cross, Richard Budgett, Andy Holmes and Adrian Ellison, he won the coxed fours event. He continued in partnership with Holmes, winning gold four years later in Seoul in the coxless pairs. 


A NEW PARTNER


After the Games in Seoul, Redgrave teamed up with Matthew Pinsent. They were to become formidable partners, winning gold at the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992. The pair continued to dominate this event and went on to win the following three world championships. At the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996, they had a significant lead of 3.04 seconds halfway through the final race, which they won comfortably. This was their 100th race together. 


PERMISSION TO SHOOT


After his victory in Atlanta, Redgrave announced on television: “Anybody who sees me in a boat has my permission to shoot me.” This did not last long, however. Teaming up this time not only with Pinsent, but also with Cracknell and Foster, he earned a fifth gold medal after a suspense-filled race, in the coxless fours at the Olympic Games Sydney 2000.


THE GREATEST ROWER OF ALL TIME


Steven Redgrave is one of the five Olympians to have won at least one gold medal at five successive editions of the Olympic Games, and is widely considered to be the greatest rower in history.

Matthew Pinsent is a four-time Olympic rowing champion, who rose to prominence in a partnership with legendary compatriot Steven Redgrave.


University rower


Matthew Pinsent was a student at Oxford University when he won a bronze medal in the coxed four at the 1989 World Championship. He was then given the honour of becoming the coxless pair partner of rowing legend Stephen Redgrave.


Redgrave and Pinsent 


They won the World Championship in 1991 and then easily claimed the Olympic title in 1992. The pair continued to dominate their event, gaining gold medals in the next three World Championships. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, the pair built a huge lead of 3.04 seconds at the halfway mark of the final and then won comfortably. It was their 100th race together.


Coxless four


After the Atlanta Games, they switched to the coxless four and won three more World Championships. The British crew of Redgrave, Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster went undefeated for three years until they unexpectedly placed fourth at the Lucerne meet. Three months later at the 2000 Sydney Games, the British led the final from start to finish, holding off a strong finish by the Italian crew.


Athens finale


At the 2004 Athens Games, Pinsent again rowed in the coxless four. In a sensational race, the British and Canadian crews crossed the finish line together. It took three minutes for the officials to determine that Pinsent and his crew had won by just ten centimetres. Pinsent had become only the third rower to win gold medals at four different editions of the Olympic Games.

Marine McBean’s first appearance on the international rowing scene was in 1986, when she came in third in the coxless pairs at that year’s Junior World Championships. She debuted in the senior edition in 1989 with a fourth-place finish in the coxless fours, alongside Kirsten Barnes, Kathleen Heddle, and Brenda Taylor, a feat that the quartet repeated the following year. From that point, however, with only one exception, McBean would not fail to reach the podium in a World Championship, Pan American, or Olympic event for the remainder of her career. In 1991 and 1992 she never lost a major race, winning gold in the coxless pairs and the eights at the World Championships and Olympic Games. Seeking individual glory, she was second in the single sculls at the 1993 World Championships, but returned to team rowing with a silver medal in the double sculls at the 1994 edition. She earned gold in the event at the 1995 World Championships, where she also captured silver in the quadruple sculls. That year she also took Pan American titles in both disciplines, and followed up with gold in the double and bronze in the quadruple at the 1996 Summer Olympics. She took the 1997 season off, but returned in 1998 by winning silver in the coxless fours and bronze in the eights at the World Championships. Her sole podium miss came at the 1999 World Championships, where she was sixth in the single sculls, and she was slated to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics, but withdrew due to a back injury, subsequently retiring from the sport. Since then she has worked as a “Specialist in Olympic Athlete Preparation and Mentoring” with the Canadian Olympic Committee. Among her many honors are induction into the Canadian Olympic (1994) and Canada’s Sports (1997) Halls of Fame and she holds a degree in kinesiology from the University of Western Ontario.

Kathleen Heddle’s original athletic pursuit at the University of British Columbia was volleyball but, in her third year, she switched to rowing and never looked back. By 1987 she was a member of the Canadian national team and, later that year, won gold in the coxless pairs event at the Pan American Games alongside Kirsten Barnes. She saw less success over the next few years, coming in fourth in the coxless fours at the 1989 and 1990 World Championships, but then began the streak that would lead her to be named one of Canada’s greatest all-time rowers. Between 1991 and her 1996 retirement, she won three gold medals at the World Championships (coxless pairs and eights in 1991 and double sculls in 1995), in addition to silver in the coxed fours in 1995, and just as many at the Olympics (coxless pairs and eights in 1992 and double sculls in 1996), as well as bronze in the quadruple sculls in 1996. She later worked with the International Rowing Federation, serving as chair of the athletes’ commission from 2000 through 2001, and has remained active in sports administration. She is a member of the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame (1994), the Order of British Columbia (1997), Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the University of British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame (2002), and the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame (2003).

Agostino Abbagnale was the younger brother of the renowned Italian rowing twins, Giuseppe and Carmine Abbagnale. But Agostino bettered them by winning three Olympic gold medals – the 1988 quad scull, the 1996 double scull, and back in the quad in 2000.  He did not compete in the 1992 Olympics because of problems with blood clots in his legs, which forced him to out of competitive rowing for five years. At the 1988 Olympics, Agostino jumped in the lake after his victory and landed on his boatmates, Davide Tizzano, knocking the gold medal out of his hand. It was not recovered until scuba divers found it two days later. Agostino Abbagnale also won World Championship titles in 1997 and 1998 in the quad, and silvers in the double in 2002 and as a sweeper with the eights in 1985.  He retired in 2003 after a recurrence of his problem with blood clots.

A descendant of Danish sailors, Brazil’s Torben Grael honoured his maritime roots at six editions of the Olympic Games, winning five medals.


Sailing DNA


Born in Sao Paulo of Danish descent, Torben Grael hailed from a rich sailing tradition. He was introduced to the water when he was just five, taken under the wing of his grandfather Preben Schmidt - one of the pioneers of Brazilian sailing - and his uncles, Erik and Axel Preben-Schmidt , who represented Brazil at the Olympic Games in 1968 ad 1972. They took him out on Aileen, a 6m class vessel, which had been used at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, by Denmark’s silver medal-winning crew of Herschend, Meulengracht and Thomsen. After his family relocated to Niteroi, opposite Rio de Janeiro in Guanabara Bay, Torben and his younger brother Lars began competing. Together they won the world junior title in the Snipe class in 1978, going on to lift the senior title in the same class in 1983 and 1987. The two brothers competed together for the best part of a decade, before deciding to go their separate ways (Lars would go on to win two Olympic bronze medals in the Snipe class in 1988 and 1996).


Six Games, five medals 


Grael made his Olympic debut at Los Angeles 1984, at the age of 24, when he competed with Ronaldo Senft and Daniel Adler in the Soling class. The trio won silver behind the USA. Four years later in Seoul he was back on Olympic waters, this time in the Star class with Nelson Falcao, and the pair claimed bronze. Grael then began a long partnership with Marcelo Ferreira in the Star. It would eventually develop into a fruitful association, but at Barcelona 1992, they could do no better than 11th place. Then came three successive podium finishes - gold at Atlanta 1996, bronze at Sydney 2000, and gold again at Athens 2004. Grael’s tally of five Olympic medals set a new record, though at London 2012 was equalled by his compatriot Robert Scheidt, and Great Britain’s Ben Ainslie.


Sailor of the Seven Seas


Grael’s uncanny ability to get the most out of his vessel regardless of the weather conditions earned him the nickname of “Turbine”. Away from the Olympic Games, he competed in the Americas Cup on three occasions, either as tactician or a member of the afterguard. In 2000, he was part of the Italian Prada team that challenged Team New Zealand for the trophy, and in 2007 he was part of the Luna Rossa crew that lost the final of the Louis Vuitton Cup - the event to decide the identity of the challenger in the America’s Cup. He twice skippered crews in the the Volvo Ocean Race, navigating Brasil 1 to third place in 2005-2006 before winning the race in 2008-2009. Chosen to carry the flag for the Brazilian team at Athens 2004, Grael was named ISAF World Sailor of the Year in 2009, and, despite hailing from a country where football dominates, he is regarded as one of Brazil’s greatest sporting figures. He once said: “The boat isn’t important, it’s all about the knowledge of the sailor.” Grael certainly had enough to last him a lifetime.

Ian Walker was already a world champion in the International 14 class before he teamed up with John Merricks to campaign in the 470 class. After placing second in the 1996 World Championships the pair repeated the feat at the Atlanta Olympics and were only denied a chance of the gold medal by a disqualification in race four. Sadly their partnership was to end in tragedy. In October 1997 the two men were being driven back to their hotel after racing in the European Championships when the driver lost control and veered off the road. Merricks was killed instantly in the accident. After some time away from the water Walker reappeared with new partner Mark Covell.  Covell had also suffered personal tragedy when his sailing partner, 1996 Olympian Glyn Charles, had been lost at sea during the 1998 Sydney-to-Hobart race. Together Walker and Covell were the British entry in the Star class at the Sydney Olympics. They came within a point of an emotive victory but lost out to the American pair in the battle for the Olympic title. Since then Walker has been involved in the crew in prospective America’s Cup challengers from Great Britain (2002-3 as skipper) and Italy (2007 as tactician). He also coached Shirley Robertson to Olympic gold in 2004.

Olympic success


Kong made his Olympic debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games. He and his partner Guoliang won gold in the men’s doubles. Four years later, the doubles pair had to settle for silver in Sydney. But Kong stormed into the men’s singles final where he faced table tennis legend Jan-Ove Waldner. 


Epic battle


In the final, Kong promptly won the first two sets. But the veteran Waldner fought back to level the match. In the crucial fifth set, Kong held his nerve to win the game and claim gold. In many ways this moment signalled the passing of the torch from the old master Waldner to the new master Kong.


All-time great


Kong is considered one of the all time greats of table tennis. He is currently the coach of China’s national women’s team.

Sydney


Four years later, Guoliang Liu went to the Sydney Games to defend his titles. However, he was easily beaten in the singles semi-final and had to settle for bronze. In the doubles, he played with teammate Linghui Kong and won silver.

Too short


The biggest obstacle in Deng Yaping's table tennis career was not her opponents, but her height. When she was 13 years old she won the national championship but was refused a spot on the national team due to her small size. They finally saw sense and let her in a year later.


Double gold


At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Deng and her partner Qiao Hong won the doubles title. They later faced each other in the singles final. Deng won the first two sets easily but Hong fought back and won the third and led in the fourth. However, Deng regained control and won 23-21 to earn her second gold medal.


Unprecedented success


Deng went on to dominate the sport and successfully defended her Olympic titles in 1996. She also won the singles World Championship title in 1991, 1995 and 1997 and the doubles World Championship title in 1989, 1995 and 1997. Hong Qiao was her partner in all of those finals, except at the 1997 World Championships, when she was partnered by Ying Yang.


Retiring at the top


Deng retired at the age of 24 having won more titles than any other player in the history of table tennis. She continued to play a role in the Olympic Movement and in 1997 was elected to the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes’ Commission. In 2003, she was voted Chinese Athlete of the Century.

Hong Qiao took up table tennis at the age of seven. In 1987, aged 19, she joined the Chinese national team. Despite several good results, she was not selected for the Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988. It must be said that her team was of a high level: her three compatriots all stood on the Korean Olympic podium. In 1991, Hong won the singles and doubles World Championships. With such results, she was ready to compete in her first Olympic Games the following year in Barcelona.


A Chinese Olympic double final


In the doubles competition, she partnered with Yaping Deng, another queen of the little celluloid ball. Three wins in the pool stage, then a quarter-final and semi-final overcome took them into the final. Hong Qiao and her partner found their compatriots Zihe Chen and Jun Gao for an all-Chinese match. The latter pair was beaten by Deng and Qiao, losing 3 sets to 1, giving Hong her first Olympic title.


Partners opposed


In Barcelona, the individual competition was a repeat of the doubles for Hong Qiao. She progressed through the rounds meeting little resistance. The final was sure to be exciting, pitting Hong against her usual doubles partner, Yaping Deng. The two players knew each other’s game by heart, making it a highly psychological encounter which favoured Yaping. Hong had the consolation of a silver medal.


A second Chinese Olympic double final


In the doubles, Deng and Qiao continued playing together for another four years. In Atlanta in 1996, they saved some match points in the quarter-final, before winning the semi-final and the final by 3 sets to 1. Facing the Chinese pair Yunping Quiao and Wei Liu, they retained the Olympic title they had won in 1992.


Inspiring the next generation


In the singles competition, Hong Qiao was beaten in the semi-final by Jing Chen, the 1988 Olympic champion. Despite the disappointment of missing another Olympic final, the Wuhan girl made it a point of honour to win the bronze medal. In the end, only her training partner compatriots managed to beat her at the Olympic Games. Since 2003, she has been sharing the experience acquired as a player by training the Chinese team. Her young pupils will no doubt be hoping to one day equal her fantastic achievement of four Olympic medals, two of them gold.

Jana Novotná started out as a well-known doubles player and remained so throughout her career. However, she developed into a top-flight singles player best known for her failures and triumphs at Wimbledon, perfectly exemplifying the words from the Kipling poem that are emblazoned above the All-England Club’s entrance to Centre Court, “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same.”


Novotná reached four Grand Slam singles finals. She lost the final of the 1987 Australian Open to Monica Seles in three sets. In 1993 Novotná reached the Wimbledon final where she faced Steffi Graf. The match went into the third set, which Novotá led 4-1, and had a game point on serve for 5-1, but the pressure overcame her, and Graf won that game and then won the final five games, to win the set, the match, and the tournament. At the victory ceremony, when Novotná was given her runner-up trophy by the Duchess of Kent, she famously cried on the Duchess’s shoulder.


Novotná returned to the Wimbledon final in 1997, but lost again in three sets, that time to Martina Hingis. In 1998, Novotná finally overcame her demons on Centre Court, winning Wimbledon by defeating Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets, in one of the most popular Wimbledon victories ever. She received her trophy, the Venus Rosewater Dish, from the Duchess of Kent. Novotná was the oldest woman in the Open Era to win her first Grand Slam title.


Novotná won 24 professional singles titles in her career but the 1998 Wimbledon was her only Grand Slam, although she did win the 1997 Tour Final. In doubles, she won 12 Grand Slams, and added four Grand Slam titles in mixed doubles. In all, she won 76 doubles titles. She achieved a career best singles rank of #2 in 1997 and had a best doubles rank of #1.


Novotná settled in Florida, doing some tennis commentary on television, until returning to her hometown of Brno in the Czech Republic, eventually building a home in the small neighboring village of Omice, where she lived with her partner. She died very young, at age 49, after a long battle with cancer, which she fought very privately. She was the first women’s Grand Slam champion of the Open Era to pass away.

Aranxa Sánchez-Vicario’s Olympic Games performance spans over 12 years and includes four medals, a record she shares with Steffi Graf.


A tennis player from early on


The Spanish tennis player started playing tennis at the age of four, following in the footsteps of her two older brothers who also went on to be professional players. She played her first Grand Slam tournament at the age of 15, in 1986. She went on to win the French Open Singles for the first time in 1989. Sánchez-Vicario was part of the Olympic tennis tournament in 1988, when tennis was included again in the Olympic programme. She was, however, knocked out in the first round.


4 medals, one record


In 1992, the young tennis player competed in her second Olympic Games on home ground. She was beaten in the semi-final but went on to win bronze in the singles tournament. Together with Conchita Martínez she succeeded better in the doubles tournament where she won the silver medal. Atlanta in 1996 also saw Aranxa return with a silver medal, after losing to Lindsey Davenport in the singles final, and a bronze medal in women’s doubles.


A well deserved retirement


Aranxa competed at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004. Shortly after, in 2004, she retired from professional tennis, a sport she had been playing for 29 years. Her retirement was well-deserved after having won four Olympic medals (a record shared with Steffi Graf), four Grand Slam singles titles, six doubles titles (for eight finals lost) and 92 other titles on the international circuit. She had also been the world number one in 1995.

Kurt Brugger began to race for the Italian national team in the various youth categories both in singles and doubles with Wilfried Huber, winning a gold medal in the individual and one bronze in doubles at the 1988 World Junior Championships in Olang. In the World Cup he débuted in the 1986-87 season competing in both singles and doubles, but soon abandoned singles, focusing only on doubles, where he earned his first Cup podium in 1987 in Olang (silver) and his first win in 1988 in Sarajevo. In the overall World Cup doubles standings he placed second four times. During his career, Brugger participated in four editions of the Winter Olympics with the highlight coming at Lillehammer in 1994, winning Olympic gold in doubles. In the course of his career he also won four medals at the World Championships, two silver and two bronze medals and four other European Championship medals, including gold in the 1994 team competition. Retiring from active competition after the 2002-03 season Brugger devoted himself to mountain climbing. His most important undertaking was to climb Nanga Parbat, one of the highest and most dreaded peaks in the Himalayas. Brugger was a trained forester. After years on the staff of the Italian national luge team, he became head coach in 2013.

During his international career spanning more than 20 years, Wilfried Huber competed in both singles and doubles, although it was doubles where he achieved the most merits together with his partner Kurt Brugger. He made his début in the World Cup in the 1986-87 season gaining his first podium rank in January 1987 and first victory in December 1988, both in doubles. In the overall World Cup the pair placed second in the 1989-90, 1992-93, 1994-95 and 1997-98 seasons and Huber placed third once in singles in the 1996-97 season. He won a total of 10 World Cup races, three in singles and seven in doubles.


Huber participated in six Winter Olympics, equaling the record for winter sports. He could have improved the record, but after the 2010 selections the Italian head coach Walter Plaikner decided not to include him on the squad, and Huber retired at the end of the season. His outstanding success was the gold medal win in doubles with Brugger at Lillehammer in1994, beating another Italian couple with his brother Norbert Hubert, and Hansjörg Raffl. In the same Olympics his brother Günther Huber won the bronze medal in the two-man bobsleigh and only the fourth brother Arnold Huber narrowly missed a medal, placing fourth in singles. At the World Championships Wilfried Huber won seven medals, two silver and five bronze, winning medals in all events (single, double and team). He also won one silver and bronze medal at the 1988 Junior World Championships. He won six medals at the European Championships – one gold, three silver and two bronze medals. After retiring from racing, Huber joined the coaching staff of the Italian national luge team. In 1995 he was awarded the Gold Cross of Merit of the Army.

During his career Hansjörg Raffl competed in both singles and doubles, but he was most successful in his specialty, doubles. In 1974 he became a member of the national team. Early in his career he teamed-up with Alfred Silginer, competing with him until 1980. The next season he started with Karl Brunner before he and Norbert Huber formed one of the most long-lasting and successful couples in luge history. Raffl made his first World Cup podium in 1979, winning his first World Cup race in 1982, both in doubles. In the overall standings he was ranked second in singles in 1979 and won eight trophies in doubles, a record he achieved together with Huber.


Raffl participated in five consecutive Olympic Winter Games. At Sarajevo in 1984 a fall dropped his doubles team from second at the split to a ninth place finish. Four years later he could not compete in doubles, because his partner was ill. Raffl took both his medals in doubles, winning bronze in 1992 and silver in 1994, when they finished behind another Italian team with Huber’s brother Wilfried Huber and Kurt Brugger. During his international career (1978-94) Raffl won nine World Championship medals, two of them gold – 1989 team and 1990 doubles, along with four silver and three bronze medals. Raffl won seven medals at the European Championships – two gold, two silver and three bronze. After his active career Raffl became coach of the Italian national team.

During his career, Norbert Huber competed in both singles and doubles. He was successful in both disciplines, although it was doubles where he achieved the most. The only missing title in an outstanding career was an Olympic victory, partly due to some poor luck. Huber participated in four Winter Olympics. At Sarajevo in 1984 he made a mistake that made him and his partner fall off the toboggan, dropping them from second at the split to ninth at the finish. Four years later he could not compete because of illness. He won both his medals in doubles, bronze in 1992, and silver in 1994 (behind another Italian team with his brother Wilfried Huber and Kurt Brugger). At Lillehammer, a third brother Günther Huber, won a bronze medal in the two-man bobsleigh. Only the fourth brother Arnold Huber failed to win an Olympic medal, settling for fourth place in 1994 in singles luge. Norbert Huber finished his career at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.


During his international career (1983-99), Huber won a total of 12 World Championships medals, two gold – in the 1989 team and 1990 doubles, along with five silver and five bronze medals. He won 14 medals at the Europeans– three gold, five silver and six bronze. In the World Cup he captured his first podium and his first win in February 1982 in doubles. Huber was the first athlete to win the overall standings of the World Cup in singles and in doubles in the same year (1984-85 and 1985-86). He holds the record of winning 11 overall World Cups, three in singles and eight in doubles, always with his long-time partner Hansjörg Raffl.


After retiring from racing he managed the family hotel “Mühlwald” in Selva dei Molini together with his wife Brunhilde and her three children. In addition he is a member of the technical staff of the national luge team. Norbert Huber was awarded the Bronze and Silver Cross of Merit of the Army.

Friends since the age of six, Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt grew up in Ilmenau, the hometown of both 1988 luge individual gold medalist Jens Mueller.  Krausse and Behrendt themselves took home silver medals in the double-seater event in 1988, trailing East German teammates Jörg Hoffmann and Jochen Pietzsch by a tenth of a second.  At the 1992 Albertville Olympics, Krausse and Behrendt moved up the platform to the gold medal stand.  Two years later in the Lillehammer Games, they completed their set of medals by placing third.  By the time of the 1998 Nagano Olympics, Krausse and Behrendt were 31 years old.  This time they took a lead of 42 one-thousandths of a second on the first run and withstood the challenge of Americans Chris Thorpe and Gordon Sheer to hold on for the victory.  They are the only double-seater sliders to earn medals in four Olympics.

Katya Gordeyeva and Sergey Grinkov were the best pairs skaters at the end of the 1980s and many consider them to be the greatest pairs team ever to take the ice. They rose into prominence in 1986, when they won their first gold at the World Championships. They would later win three more golds at the World Championships (1987, 1989, 1990) and one silver in 1988. At the European Championships, Gordeyeva and Grinkov won golds in 1988, 1990 and 1994 and a silver in 1986. They also won gold at the 1988 Winter Olympics, their only Soviet title coming in 1987. Gordeyeva and Grinkov turned professional in 1990 and in April 1991 they married, with a daughter born in 1992.


As professionals, Gordeyeva and Grinkov won the World Professional Championships in 1991, 1992 and 1994 and toured with Stars on Ice. But when a new ISU rule allowed professional skaters to regain their Olympic eligibility, the pair returned to amateur competition for the 1993-94 season and skated at the Olympics, winning their second gold. In 1994 they won their only Russian title. After their second Olympics, the pair again turned professional and toured with Stars on Ice. In the summer of 1995, Gordeyeva and Grinkov were inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and planned to return to Stars on Ice for their fourth season.


But on 20 November 1995, while the pair was rehearsing for opening night of the upcoming tour, Grinkov collapsed on the ice and died at age 28 from a massive heart attack. Doctors later discovered that Grinkov had a congenital heart condition which caused his death. In February 1996, Gordeyeva returned to the ice, this time as a solo performer and skated with Stars on Ice until 2000, when she took some time off to give a birth to a second daughter. A year later, Gordeyeva married Ilya Kulik, the father of her second daughter and the 1998 Winter Olympic singles gold medalist. Gordeyeva skated professionally until 2007. She later worked as a skating coach and choreographer in the United States, and published two books, My Sergei: A Love Story (1996), which in 1998 was made into a movie “My Sergei,” starring Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze as Gordeyeva and Grinkov, and A Letter for Daria (1998).

Isabelle Brassuer first teamed up with partner Lloyd Eisler to compete in pairs figure skating in 1987, which began a partnership that would last for 17 years and see many successes. Together they were runners-up at their first Canadian Championship together in 1988, in addition to placing 7th at the World Championships and 9th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The following year they were 7th again at the World Championships, but took the Canadian Championships and would never again fail to see the podium at a Canadian, World or Olympic Championship. The duo took second place at the 1990 World Championships, but slid to third at their national tournament. They regained the Canadian title the following year and held it through 1994. During that time, they won two bronze medals at the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994, as well as two more silver medals (1991 and 1994), one bronze (1992), and one gold (1993) at the World Championships.


Brassuer and Eisler retired from active competition in 1994, but continued their professional relationship through other channels. Along with a woman by the name of Lou-Anne Brosseau, they formed B.B.E. Productions in 1992, which organized charity figure skating events across Canada to benefit the Children’s Wish Foundation. The organization won several awards, put on over 25 shows, and raised more than a quarter of a million dollars until it ceased operating in 2006. After their second Olympic medal, the duo was awarded the Meritorious Service Decoration in 1994 and was inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1996 and 2000 respectively. In 1996 she wrote the book “Brasseur & Eisler: To Catch a Dream” and later followed it up with “Brasseur & Eisler: The Professional Years”. In 2009 she appeared on the Canadian figure skating reality show “Battle of the Blades”, but was voted off the show in the second episode, along with her partner and former NHL player Glenn Anderson.

Jayne Torvill and her partner Christopher Dean broke the Russian domination of ice skate dancing and mesmerised the world with their interpretation of Ravel’s Bolero.


Russian domination broken


At the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Games, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of Nottingham, England, won the ice dance competition. This was the first time that the competition had been won by a non-Russian couple.


Ravel’s Bolero


The British couple mesmerised the world with their breathtaking interpretation of Maurice Ravel’s Bolero. The judges awarded them 12 scores of 6.0 out of 18 marks, including across-the-board perfect scores for artistic impression.


Clever timing


The couple managed to present their 4-minute 28-second dance despite the fact that the time limit was 4 minutes 10 seconds. They did this by moving their bodies to the music for 18 seconds before they started skating.


Bronze return


Torvill and Dean returned to the Olympic Games in 1994. However, they could not match the astonishing performance they had produced ten years earlier and finished in bronze medal position.

Gustav Weder and his brakeman, Donat Acklin, made their Olympic debut in 1988, placing fourth in the two-man bobsleigh.  By 1992 they were the favourites to win gold or silver.


Catching up for gold


However, after the first two of four runs, they were in only fifth place. The next day, Weder and Acklin roared into first place for their first Olympic championship. Later they joined with Lorenz Schindelholz and Curdin Morell to add bronze medals in the four-man event. 


A meticulous competitor 


Two years later at the Albertville Games, Weder and Acklin found themselves trailing Reto Götschi and Guido Acklin (Donat’s younger brother) after three runs. On the final run, they edged ahead of their teammates to win by five hundredths of a second and thus become the first repeat winners of the two-man bobsleigh event. In the four-man contest, where they were joined this time by Kurt Meier and Domenico Semeraro, Weder faltered slightly at the end of the first run and ended up in fourth place.


However, he was able to win each of the remaining three runs and earn silver medals for his team. Weder was such an intense competitor that he videotaped every metre of every run he raced on and studied the videos for hours.

Reto Götschi took up bobsled in 1986 and drew attention for his skill at the 1991 World Junior Championships. His first, and arguably greatest, major international achievement came at the 1994 Winter Olympics where, with partner Guido Acklin, he finished 0.05 seconds behind Acklin’s brother Donat and compatriot Gustav Weder to claim silver in the two-man event. After coming in third and second at the 1995 and 1996 European Championships respectively, he was third in two-man at the 1996 World Championships, but then earned gold the following year. He was also the original winner of the four-man event, but was disqualified alongside the second- and third-placing Swiss teams for competing with a bobsled that the national team had been using all season, unaware that it was illegal. He was also champion in the four-man and third place in the two-man at the 1997 European Championships.


Götschi and Acklin returned to the Winter Olympics in 1998 as reigning World and European Champions, but a strong pool of competitors relegated them to sixth place in the two-man. Acklin retired from active competition in 1999, after a final European title in the two-man, but Götschi continued to compete and earned silver in the two-man at the 2001 World Championships, alongside Cédric Grand. Götschi retired from active competition in May 2002, having captured nine Swiss national titles in the two-man and two in the four-man. By career he was originally a home building and house inspector but, in August 2011, he became the CEO of )Swiss Sliding”, Switzerland’s luge, bobsleigh, and skeleton federation.

His first, and arguably greatest, major international achievement came at the 1994 Winter Olympics, when he finished 0.05 seconds behind his brother Donat and compatriot Gustav Weder to claim silver in the two-man event.

As the reigning world champions they were favored at the 1998 Winter Olympics, but a strong pool of competitors relegated them to sixth place in the two-man. Their record at the European Championships was strong as well\: first in 1998 and 1999, second in 1996, and third in 1995 and 1997. They were also the 1997 European Champions in the four-man, with Beat Seitz and the non-Olympian Daniel Giger. Acklin retired from active competition in 1999, but made a comeback two years later, switching his focus to the four-man event. At the 2002 Winter Olympics he came in sixth, alongside Urs Aeberhard, Steve Anderhub, and Christian Reich, and returned to retirement shortly thereafter.

Like his brothers, Günther Huber began his career as a luger with his best result being a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in his specialty, doubles in 1982. He switched to bobsledding as a pilot in 1988 , stating he was ""tired of losing against the brothers."" In this new discipline he achieved all his best results. He participated in four consecutive Winter Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the two-man bobsled together with Stefano Ticci in 1994. At the same Olympics, his brothers Wilfried and Norbert also took home medals, while Arnold had to settle for fourth place. At Nagano in 1998 Günther Huber won gold in the two-man with brakeman Antonio Tartaglia, tied with the Canadian crew of Pierre Lueders.


During his career Huber won two medals at World Championships, both in the two-man, a silver medal in 1997 with Tartaglia and the gold medal in 1999. This success came after a disastrous period, which started four months prior with the theft of his bob, continued with injuries to his long-time partner Tartaglia and substitute Massimiliano Rota, and ultimately ended with another injury to replacement Enrico Costa, who had to be replaced by Ubaldo Ranzi. In the World Cup Huber made the podium for the first time in the 1991-92 season with a third place in St. Moritz in the two-man and in the same event he achieved his first World Cup victory in the following season in Lillehammer. In the overall standings he won the trophy in his specialty, the two-man, in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons, while in 1996-97 he won the combined World Cup. At the European Championships Huber won another six medals, two of them gold, one each in the two-man and four-man event. Between 1991 and 2001 he won seven national titles in the two-man and one in the four-man bob.


Huber was a member of the Carabinieri, the national military police of Italy, and became bobsled coach for the Italian national team in 2008. He was awarded the Bronze Cross of Merit of the Army twice (1994, 1999) and the Gold Cross of Merit in 1998.

Stefano Ticci took part in four Winter Olympics, in 1984 with pilot Marco Bellodis and in 1988 with pilot Ivo Ferriano. After competing for two years with Roberto D'Amico, success came when he teamed up with Günther Huber ultimately winning the bronze medal in the two-man bob at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, his last Olympics. In the same year he was European Champion in the four-man, after previously winning one bronze and silver medal each in the two-man with Huber. At home, he won three Italian Championships in the two-man bob with Ferriano in 1988 and in 1990-91 with D’Amico. Ticci was honored by his home province Lucca for his sports achievements. He later became a policeman.

Scott Strausbaugh and his partner, Joe Jacobi, were US Champions in whitewater canoe doubles from 1988-92 and were expected to contend for a medal in that event at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The pair had had three World Cup podium finishes in 1990-91, with a silver and two bronzes, but they were not gold medal favorites. That role went to several European pairs, mainly the 1991 World Champions from France, Franck Adisson and Wilfrid Forgues. However, the Europeans pairs struggled in the first round and Strausbaugh and Jacobi took the lead and held on to win the gold medal. Strausbaugh and Jacobi trained at the Nantahala Whitewater Center in Bryson City, North Carolina.

A junior world champion in 1987, Wilfrid Forgues went on to forge a hugely successful partnership with Franck Adisson that saw them regularly win medals in the Canadian pairs slalom category in the years that straddled the 20th and 21st centuries. 


Forgues and Adisson were ten times champions of France and four times World Championship gold medallist but the highlight of their career came with victory at the Ocoee Whitewater Center during the 1996 Summer Olympics. The duo had already won bronze at Barcelona and would return to compete, without medal success, at the Sydney Games.


Retiring shortly after the 2000 Olympics he set up his own computer company and later accepted the post of President of his region’s canoe federation.In 2016, by then married and the father of two teenaged children, Forgues decided to reveal his struggle with gender identity to his family, separated with his wife and began to live his life as a woman. Two years later he revealed to the newspaper L'Équipe that he had begun to take female hormones and was due to undergo gender reassignment surgery in Spring 2019.

Italy's Antonio Rossi has won Olympic medals at four consecutive Olympics. Having started canoeing at age 15, he débuted at the Olympics in Barcelona, where he immediately captured a bronze medal in the K-2 500, along with Bruno Dreossi. His most successful Games were in Atlanta, where he won two gold medals, one in the K-1 500m, and one in the K-2 1,000, together with Daniele Scarpa. He retained that last title at the Sydney Olympics, albeit with Beniamino Bonomi. The same duo would win Olympic silver in Athens, with just 0.064 seconds separating them from the gold. Rossi's last Olympic appearance was in Beijing, where he carried the Italian flag during the opening. He now contested the K-4 event, but was unable to win a sixth medal, finishing fourth in the final. Apart from the Olympics, Rossi also starred at World Championships. His best event was the K-2 1,000, winning medals in five consecutive championships. After silver in 1993 and 1994, he won his first title in 1995 (all with Scarpa). This was followed in 1997 and 1998 by two more titles, now with Luca Negri. Rossi also won a silver in the K-4 200 (1998) and a bronze in the K-1 500 (1997). Rossi, who married fellow kayaker Lucia Micheli shortly after his Atlanta wins, was voted on the board of the Italian NOC during his active career. He also became involved in regional politics, and was appointed as councillor for sports in his native province of Lecco in 2009. A devout Catholic, Antonio Rossi was also present at the 2000 Jubilee of sports People, where he addressed the pope and was elected as athlete representative of the Jubilee.

Steven redgrave is widely considered to be the greatest rower of all time, winning gold medals at five successive editions of the olympic games.


FIRST GOLD MEDAL


The extraordinary tally of Redgrave’s Olympic medals started in Los Angeles in 1984. With Martin Cross, Richard Budgett, Andy Holmes and Adrian Ellison, he won the coxed fours event. He continued in partnership with Holmes, winning gold four years later in Seoul in the coxless pairs. 


A NEW PARTNER


After the Games in Seoul, Redgrave teamed up with Matthew Pinsent. They were to become formidable partners, winning gold at the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992. The pair continued to dominate this event and went on to win the following three world championships. At the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996, they had a significant lead of 3.04 seconds halfway through the final race, which they won comfortably. This was their 100th race together. 


PERMISSION TO SHOOT


After his victory in Atlanta, Redgrave announced on television: “Anybody who sees me in a boat has my permission to shoot me.” This did not last long, however. Teaming up this time not only with Pinsent, but also with Cracknell and Foster, he earned a fifth gold medal after a suspense-filled race, in the coxless fours at the Olympic Games Sydney 2000.


THE GREATEST ROWER OF ALL TIME


Steven Redgrave is one of the five Olympians to have won at least one gold medal at five successive editions of the Olympic Games, and is widely considered to be the greatest rower in history.

Matthew Pinsent is a four-time Olympic rowing champion, who rose to prominence in a partnership with legendary compatriot Steven Redgrave.


University rower


Matthew Pinsent was a student at Oxford University when he won a bronze medal in the coxed four at the 1989 World Championship. He was then given the honour of becoming the coxless pair partner of rowing legend Stephen Redgrave.


Redgrave and Pinsent 


They won the World Championship in 1991 and then easily claimed the Olympic title in 1992. The pair continued to dominate their event, gaining gold medals in the next three World Championships. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, the pair built a huge lead of 3.04 seconds at the halfway mark of the final and then won comfortably. It was their 100th race together.


Coxless four


After the Atlanta Games, they switched to the coxless four and won three more World Championships. The British crew of Redgrave, Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster went undefeated for three years until they unexpectedly placed fourth at the Lucerne meet. Three months later at the 2000 Sydney Games, the British led the final from start to finish, holding off a strong finish by the Italian crew.


Athens finale


At the 2004 Athens Games, Pinsent again rowed in the coxless four. In a sensational race, the British and Canadian crews crossed the finish line together. It took three minutes for the officials to determine that Pinsent and his crew had won by just ten centimetres. Pinsent had become only the third rower to win gold medals at four different editions of the Olympic Games.

Marine McBean’s first appearance on the international rowing scene was in 1986, when she came in third in the coxless pairs at that year’s Junior World Championships. She debuted in the senior edition in 1989 with a fourth-place finish in the coxless fours, alongside Kirsten Barnes, Kathleen Heddle, and Brenda Taylor, a feat that the quartet repeated the following year. From that point, however, with only one exception, McBean would not fail to reach the podium in a World Championship, Pan American, or Olympic event for the remainder of her career. In 1991 and 1992 she never lost a major race, winning gold in the coxless pairs and the eights at the World Championships and Olympic Games. Seeking individual glory, she was second in the single sculls at the 1993 World Championships, but returned to team rowing with a silver medal in the double sculls at the 1994 edition. She earned gold in the event at the 1995 World Championships, where she also captured silver in the quadruple sculls. That year she also took Pan American titles in both disciplines, and followed up with gold in the double and bronze in the quadruple at the 1996 Summer Olympics. She took the 1997 season off, but returned in 1998 by winning silver in the coxless fours and bronze in the eights at the World Championships. Her sole podium miss came at the 1999 World Championships, where she was sixth in the single sculls, and she was slated to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics, but withdrew due to a back injury, subsequently retiring from the sport. Since then she has worked as a “Specialist in Olympic Athlete Preparation and Mentoring” with the Canadian Olympic Committee. Among her many honors are induction into the Canadian Olympic (1994) and Canada’s Sports (1997) Halls of Fame and she holds a degree in kinesiology from the University of Western Ontario.

Kathleen Heddle’s original athletic pursuit at the University of British Columbia was volleyball but, in her third year, she switched to rowing and never looked back. By 1987 she was a member of the Canadian national team and, later that year, won gold in the coxless pairs event at the Pan American Games alongside Kirsten Barnes. She saw less success over the next few years, coming in fourth in the coxless fours at the 1989 and 1990 World Championships, but then began the streak that would lead her to be named one of Canada’s greatest all-time rowers. Between 1991 and her 1996 retirement, she won three gold medals at the World Championships (coxless pairs and eights in 1991 and double sculls in 1995), in addition to silver in the coxed fours in 1995, and just as many at the Olympics (coxless pairs and eights in 1992 and double sculls in 1996), as well as bronze in the quadruple sculls in 1996. She later worked with the International Rowing Federation, serving as chair of the athletes’ commission from 2000 through 2001, and has remained active in sports administration. She is a member of the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame (1994), the Order of British Columbia (1997), Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the University of British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame (2002), and the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame (2003).

Seaton rowed at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, in the eight in 1988, and winning a bronze medal in the pair in 1992. Seaton also won four silver medals at the World Championships – the 1987 eight, the 1990 pair and eight, and the 1991 four. She rowed at the 1990 Goodwill Games, winning silver in the pair and placing sixth in the eight. Seaton was a 14-time US Champion.


Seaton later became a member of the all-female crew for America3, the first all-female crew to attempt to defend the America’s Cup, in 1995. The crew was replaced by several men and despite that, or possibly because of that, did not get through the Challengers’ Series to attempt to defend the Cup. Seaton did write a book about the experience, Making Waves: The Inside Story of Managing and Motivating the First Women's Team to Compete for the America's Cup.

She raced at four World Championships (1987, 1989-91), winning four silver medals, in the eight in 1987 and 1990, the pair also in 1990, and the four in 1991. Maxwell-Pierson also won a silver in the pair at the 1990 Goodwill Games. In 1990 she was a co-recipient of USA Rowing’s Female Athlete of the Year. She also competed four times at the Lucerne International Regatta (1987, 1989, 1991-92), claiming six first or second place finishes.


Maxwell-Pierson was part of the all-female crew for the America3 boat that attempted to defend the America’s Cup for the US in 1995. The crew participated in some trials, but was eventually replaced by some male sailors, and the America3 did not qualify to defend the Cup. The skipper of the crew was Olympian J. J. Isler who, when asked about the qualifications of the women, noted of Maxwell-Pierson, “She can bench press her husband, so I think we can overcome the strength issue.”


Maxwell-Pierson later embarked on a hotel management career with Embassy Suites in Philadelphia. She is a member of the Cornell University Sports Hall of Fame.

Eastern promiseKathrin Boron was born in the former East German town of Eisenhüttenstatd, on the border with Poland. At the age of eight, she started competing in athletics, and went on to continue his education in a sports school. In 1983, she joined the famous Potsdam rowing club where she progressed under the guidance of coach, Jutta Lau. Three years later, in Roudnice (CZE), she claimed her first international title, as a member of the East German crew that won the quadruple skulls at the 1986 World Rowing Junior Championships, and a year later claimed a second world junior title in the single sculls in Cologne.


From adversity to triumph


Selected to represent the German Democratic Republic at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Boron injured her right ankle and had to withdraw. Once she recovered she swiftly put the setback behind her to win successive golds in the quadruple sculls at the World Rowing Championships in 1989 and 1990, while in 1991 she topped the podium again, this time with a victory in the double sculls with Beate Schramm. By this point she was competing in the colours of a unified Germany. It was in the double sculls –  this time with Kerstin Koeppen –  that she tasted Olympic success for the first time, at Barcelona 1992, competing in the same boat in which she had secured her 1991 world title. 


Gold again in 1996 and 2000


On 27 July 1996 in Atlanta, Boron won another Olympic gold in the quadruple skulls, with Kerstin Koeppen, Katrin Rutschow, and Jana Rau-Sorgers. And four years later in Penrith, the venue for the rowing events at Sydney 2000, she won her third Olympic gold, this time in the double sculls with Jana Thieme.


A new dimension


Bolstered by her three Olympic titles, Boron saw her life change in 2002. As she tells it: “On 5 August, my daughter Cora was born and my life took on a new dimension. In January 2003, feeling a new impetus and sense of motivation, I launched operation ‘Athens 2004’. You know what happened next!”. At the Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre on 22 August 2004, Boron claimed yet another gold in the quadruple sculls along side Meike Evers, Manuela Lutze and Kerstin Kowalski. But she wasn’t finished yet. She still had one more Olympic Games in her, and one more medal. At Beijing 2008, she was a member of the German crew that took bronze in the quadruple sculls, after which she finally confirmed her intention to retire.


Source of inspiration


During 20 years competing at the highest level, Boron amassed a total of five Olympic and 13 world championship medals, making her one of the most successful female rowers in history and a wonderful source of inspiration for the many younger team-mates with whom she shared a boat over the years. In 2009, the international rowing federation, FISA, awarded her its highest honour, the Thomas Keller Medal.

A winning team


At the age of nineteen, she debuted at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, where she teamed with Marioara Popescu to win the double sculls final. In 1988, she earned a silver medal in the same event, this time with Veronica Cogeanu as her partner. Lipa and Cogeanu also won bronze medals in the quadruple sculls without coxswain. In 1992, Lipa, who made her living working for the Romanian equivalent of the CIA, and Cogeanu (now known as Veronica Cochela) repeated their second place finish in the double sculls. The next day, Lipa led the single sculls from start to finish to earn her second career gold medal.

At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, she placed ninth in the single sculls, but then won another gold medal as a member of Romania's coxed eight with coxswain crew. With this race, she became the first rower in Olympic history to win six medals. Lipa competed in her fifth edition of the Games in 2000 at the age of 35. At the Games in Sydney she helped Romania defend its title in the eights, thus becoming the oldest oarswoman to win a gold medal in the eight with coxswain event at the Olympic Games.


Five gold medals


Lipa holds the rowing record for most Olympic medals won (7) and she and Steve Redgrave share the record for most years between gold medals (16). At the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004, Elisabeta Lipa again won the gold medal in the Eights. Through this performance, she became the only woman to hold five gold medals at five editions of the Olympic Games (84, 92, 96, 00, 04).

She played her first Grand Slam tournament at the age of 15, in 1986. She went on to win the French Open Singles for the first time in 1989. Sánchez-Vicario was part of the Olympic tennis tournament in 1988, when tennis was included again in the Olympic programme. She was, however, knocked out in the first round.


4 medals, one record


In 1992, the young tennis player competed in her second Olympic Games on home ground. She was beaten in the semi-final but went on to win bronze in the singles tournament. Together with Conchita Martínez she succeeded better in the doubles tournament where she won the silver medal. Atlanta in 1996 also saw Aranxa return with a silver medal, after losing to Lindsey Davenport in the singles final, and a bronze medal in women’s doubles.


A well deserved retirement


Aranxa competed at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004. Shortly after, in 2004, she retired from professional tennis, a sport she had been playing for 29 years. Her retirement was well-deserved after having won four Olympic medals (a record shared with Steffi Graf), four Grand Slam singles titles, six doubles titles (for eight finals lost) and 92 other titles on the international circuit. She had also been the world number one in 1995.

After retiring, she was voted Chinese Athlete of the Century.


Too short


The biggest obstacle in Deng Yaping's table tennis career was not her opponents, but her height. When she was 13 years old she won the national championship but was refused a spot on the national team due to her small size. They finally saw sense and let her in a year later.


Double gold


At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Deng and her partner Qiao Hong won the doubles title. They later faced each other in the singles final. Deng won the first two sets easily but Hong fought back and won the third and led in the fourth. However, Deng regained control and won 23-21 to earn her second gold medal.


Unprecedented success


Deng went on to dominate the sport and successfully defended her Olympic titles in 1996. She also won the singles World Championship title in 1991, 1995 and 1997 and the doubles World Championship title in 1989, 1995 and 1997. Hong Qiao was her partner in all of those finals, except at the 1997 World Championships, when she was partnered by Ying Yang.


Retiring at the top


Deng retired at the age of 24 having won more titles than any other player in the history of table tennis. She continued to play a role in the Olympic Movement and in 1997 was elected to the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes’ Commission. In 2003, she was voted Chinese Athlete of the Century.

Hong Qiao took up table tennis at the age of seven. In 1987, aged 19, she joined the Chinese national team. Despite several good results, she was not selected for the Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988. It must be said that her team was of a high level: her three compatriots all stood on the Korean Olympic podium. In 1991, Hong won the singles and doubles World Championships. With such results, she was ready to compete in her first Olympic Games the following year in Barcelona.


A Chinese Olympic double final


In the doubles competition, she partnered with Yaping Deng, another queen of the little celluloid ball. Three wins in the pool stage, then a quarter-final and semi-final overcome took them into the final. Hong Qiao and her partner found their compatriots Zihe Chen and Jun Gao for an all-Chinese match. The latter pair was beaten by Deng and Qiao, losing 3 sets to 1, giving Hong her first Olympic title.


Partners opposed


In Barcelona, the individual competition was a repeat of the doubles for Hong Qiao. She progressed through the rounds meeting little resistance. The final was sure to be exciting, pitting Hong against her usual doubles partner, Yaping Deng. The two players knew each other’s game by heart, making it a highly psychological encounter which favoured Yaping. Hong had the consolation of a silver medal.


A second Chinese Olympic double final


In the doubles, Deng and Qiao continued playing together for another four years. In Atlanta in 1996, they saved some match points in the quarter-final, before winning the semi-final and the final by 3 sets to 1. Facing the Chinese pair Yunping Quiao and Wei Liu, they retained the Olympic title they had won in 1992.


Inspiring the next generation


In the singles competition, Hong Qiao was beaten in the semi-final by Jing Chen, the 1988 Olympic champion. Despite the disappointment of missing another Olympic final, the Wuhan girl made it a point of honour to win the bronze medal. In the end, only her training partner compatriots managed to beat her at the Olympic Games. Since 2003, she has been sharing the experience acquired as a player by training the Chinese team. Her young pupils will no doubt be hoping to one day equal her fantastic achievement of four Olympic medals, two of them gold.

Jan Behrendt and Stefan Krauße formed a redoubtable doubles luge team, competing first for the German Democratic Republic and after 1992 for Germany. At the Olympics, they won gold medals in 1992 and 1998, silver in 1988, and bronze in 1994. Behrendt and Krauße began to compete together internationally at the 1985 European Junior championships. Together, they won four World Championships – 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995; and were runners-up in 1996-97. They were also World Cup champions in 1994-96 and European champions in 1996.

Friends since the age of six, Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt grew up in Ilmenau, the hometown of both 1988 luge individual gold medalist Jens Mueller.  Krausse and Behrendt themselves took home silver medals in the double-seater event in 1988, trailing East German teammates Jörg Hoffmann and Jochen Pietzsch by a tenth of a second.  At the 1992 Albertville Olympics, Krausse and Behrendt moved up the platform to the gold medal stand.  Two years later in the Lillehammer Games, they completed their set of medals by placing third.  By the time of the 1998 Nagano Olympics, Krausse and Behrendt were 31 years old.  This time they took a lead of 42 one-thousandths of a second on the first run and withstood the challenge of Americans Chris Thorpe and Gordon Sheer to hold on for the victory.  They are the only double-seater sliders to earn medals in four Olympics.

During his career Hansjörg Raffl competed in both singles and doubles, but he was most successful in his specialty, doubles. In 1974 he became a member of the national team. Early in his career he teamed-up with Alfred Silginer, competing with him until 1980. The next season he started with Karl Brunner before he and Norbert Huber formed one of the most long-lasting and successful couples in luge history. Raffl made his first World Cup podium in 1979, winning his first World Cup race in 1982, both in doubles. In the overall standings he was ranked second in singles in 1979 and won eight trophies in doubles, a record he achieved together with Huber.


Raffl participated in five consecutive Olympic Winter Games. At Sarajevo in 1984 a fall dropped his doubles team from second at the split to a ninth place finish. Four years later he could not compete in doubles, because his partner was ill. Raffl took both his medals in doubles, winning bronze in 1992 and silver in 1994, when they finished behind another Italian team with Huber’s brother Wilfried Huber and Kurt Brugger. During his international career (1978-94) Raffl won nine World Championship medals, two of them gold – 1989 team and 1990 doubles, along with four silver and three bronze medals. Raffl won seven medals at the European Championships – two gold, two silver and three bronze. After his active career Raffl became coach of the Italian national team.

During his career, Norbert Huber competed in both singles and doubles. He was successful in both disciplines, although it was doubles where he achieved the most. The only missing title in an outstanding career was an Olympic victory, partly due to some poor luck. Huber participated in four Winter Olympics. At Sarajevo in 1984 he made a mistake that made him and his partner fall off the toboggan, dropping them from second at the split to ninth at the finish. Four years later he could not compete because of illness. He won both his medals in doubles, bronze in 1992, and silver in 1994 (behind another Italian team with his brother Wilfried Huber and Kurt Brugger). At Lillehammer, a third brother Günther Huber, won a bronze medal in the two-man bobsleigh. Only the fourth brother Arnold Huber failed to win an Olympic medal, settling for fourth place in 1994 in singles luge. Norbert Huber finished his career at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.


During his international career (1983-99), Huber won a total of 12 World Championships medals, two gold – in the 1989 team and 1990 doubles, along with five silver and five bronze medals. He won 14 medals at the Europeans– three gold, five silver and six bronze. In the World Cup he captured his first podium and his first win in February 1982 in doubles. Huber was the first athlete to win the overall standings of the World Cup in singles and in doubles in the same year (1984-85 and 1985-86). He holds the record of winning 11 overall World Cups, three in singles and eight in doubles, always with his long-time partner Hansjörg Raffl.


After retiring from racing he managed the family hotel “Mühlwald” in Selva dei Molini together with his wife Brunhilde and her three children. In addition he is a member of the technical staff of the national luge team. Norbert Huber was awarded the Bronze and Silver Cross of Merit of the Army.

Gustav Weder and his brakeman, Donat Acklin, made their Olympic debut in 1988, placing fourth in the two-man bobsleigh.  By 1992 they were the favourites to win gold or silver.


Catching up for gold


However, after the first two of four runs, they were in only fifth place. The next day, Weder and Acklin roared into first place for their first Olympic championship. Later they joined with Lorenz Schindelholz and Curdin Morell to add bronze medals in the four-man event. 


A meticulous competitor 


Two years later at the Albertville Games, Weder and Acklin found themselves trailing Reto Götschi and Guido Acklin (Donat’s younger brother) after three runs. On the final run, they edged ahead of their teammates to win by five hundredths of a second and thus become the first repeat winners of the two-man bobsleigh event. In the four-man contest, where they were joined this time by Kurt Meier and Domenico Semeraro, Weder faltered slightly at the end of the first run and ended up in fourth place.


However, he was able to win each of the remaining three runs and earn silver medals for his team. Weder was such an intense competitor that he videotaped every metre of every run he raced on and studied the videos for hours.

Modest startA former decathlete, Langen switched to bobsleigh and started competing as a brakeman in bobsleigh races in 1985. At the 1988 Calgary Winter Games, Langen came seventh in the two-man and 11th in the four-man event.


Gold as driver


Having switched to driver, Langen’s first taste of Olympic success came at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games where he won a bronze medal in the two-man competition. Four years later in Nagano, Langen added another two Olympic medals to his tally by winning the four-man competition and finishing third in the two-man event.


Two-man glory


By 2002, Langen had achieved virtually everything in his sport. With 25 Olympic, World, and European championship medals to his name, the only major victory he had not attained was the Olympic two-man gold. Yet despite his brakeman withdrawing two weeks before the Salt Lake City Winter Games, Langen and his replacement brakeman, Markus Zimmermann, came from behind to win by nine hundredths of a second.


Homemade sleds


Langen actually built his own sleds for competition. He was clearly very good, as it was acknowledged that his sleds were the fastest in the world!

After a third-place finish at the Canadian Nationals in 1985, and angry at the policies of the Canadian Figure Skating Association, they began to compete for France from 1986.

The Duchesnays also won Skate America in the 1986-87 season. They were three-time medalists at the European Championships, winning bronze in 1988 and 1990 and a silver in 1991.


The Duchesnays choreographer was Christopher Dean, the 1984 Olympic ice dancing gold medalist, and he and Isabelle would marry, but also later divorce. Their best known free dance performance was set to jungle drums and was initially quite controversial to the staid international skating judges. After the 1992 Winter Olympics the Duchesnays turned professional and skated in ice shows through 1996 when Paul was seriously injured in a rollerblading accident and they retired from professional skating.

Isabelle Brassuer first teamed up with partner Lloyd Eisler to compete in pairs figure skating in 1987, which began a partnership that would last for 17 years and see many successes. Together they were runners-up at their first Canadian Championship together in 1988, in addition to placing 7th at the World Championships and 9th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The following year they were 7th again at the World Championships, but took the Canadian Championships and would never again fail to see the podium at a Canadian, World or Olympic Championship. The duo took second place at the 1990 World Championships, but slid to third at their national tournament. They regained the Canadian title the following year and held it through 1994. During that time, they won two bronze medals at the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994, as well as two more silver medals (1991 and 1994), one bronze (1992), and one gold (1993) at the World Championships.


Brassuer and Eisler retired from active competition in 1994, but continued their professional relationship through other channels. Along with a woman by the name of Lou-Anne Brosseau, they formed B.B.E. Productions in 1992, which organized charity figure skating events across Canada to benefit the Children’s Wish Foundation. The organization won several awards, put on over 25 shows, and raised more than a quarter of a million dollars until it ceased operating in 2006. After their second Olympic medal, the duo was awarded the Meritorious Service Decoration in 1994 and was inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1996 and 2000 respectively. In 1996 she wrote the book “Brasseur & Eisler: To Catch a Dream” and later followed it up with “Brasseur & Eisler: The Professional Years”. In 2009 she appeared on the Canadian figure skating reality show “Battle of the Blades”, but was voted off the show in the second episode, along with her partner and former NHL player Glenn Anderson.

The media began focusing on Eisler after he was alleged to have been romantically involved with Swanson while his wife Marcia O’Brien was pregnant in 2005, but Eisler claimed that his relationship did not begin until he and his wife were separated. He was further scrutinized after he was suspended from coaching by Skate Canada later that year for allegedly sending sexual messages to a 15-year-old student.  Whatever the case, Swanson and Eisler were married in February of 2009.

Upon being partnered in 1985 with Carolyn Waldo, who had won a silver medal in the solo event at the 1984 Summer Olympics, she was unstoppable in the duet; among the many events in which they won gold were the 1986 Commonwealth Games, the 1986 World Championships, the 1987 Pan Pacific Championships, and the 1988 Summer Olympics. They also won gold in the team event at the 1986 World Championships and Cameron was eliminated in the first round of the solo event at the 1988 Summer Olympics, which was eventually won by Waldo. The duo retired after the Games and were immediately made members of the Order of Canada. Since leaving active competition, Cameron has worked as a motivational speaker, businesswoman, and sports administrator and has donated her time to numerous charitable endeavors. She has been inducted into the Canadian (1991), Alberta (1991), and International Aquatic (2000) Sports Halls of Fame.

At the 1984 Olympics, Carolyn Waldo finished second in the solo synchronized swimming event behind Tracie Ruiz (USA). But Waldo then displaced her as the top synchronized performer, winning the 1986 World Championships in solo and duet, partnered by Michelle Cameron, and competing on the winning team. She had also earned a team gold at the 1982 Worlds. At the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Waldo won the solo gold medal and together with Cameron, added the duet gold medal as well. Waldo won “triples,” the solo, duet, and team championships, at the 1985 FINA Cup, 1986 World Championships, and the 1987 Pan-Pacific Meet. She also competed on winning teams at the 1981 Pan-Pacifics and the 1983 Pan-American Games. Waldo won the Velma Springstead Trophy in 1985-88, given to Canada's outstanding female athlete. She was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in 1988 won the Lou Marsh Trophy, given to Canada's top athlete for  the year. Waldo later went into network news and became a sports anchor at CTV in Ottawa.

Greg Barton is usually considered the greatest flatwater kayaker produced by the United States. Barton competed at three Olympic Games, winning medals at each, highlighted by his two gold medals in 1988 in K1-1,000 and K2-1,000. He won gold medals in the same events at the 1987 Pan American Games. Barton won six medals at the World Championships, including four golds (K-1 1000 m: 1987, K-1 10000 m: 1985, 1987, 1991), a silver (K-1 10000 m: 1990), and a bronze (K-1 1000 m: 1991).


Barton graduated from the University of Michigan in 1983 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He settled in Seattle where he started and ran Epic Kayaks, which makes high-end kayaks, surfskis, and paddles. The US Canoe Association has named the Greg Barton Cup Challenge in his honor. Barton’s brother, Bruce Barton, competed at the 1976 Olympics in canoeing.

Yet that's what he became – two gold medals (K1 and K2 500 m) in one day in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984, then another the next day (K4 1000 m). Four years later, in Seoul, there was another gold medal (K2 500 m), plus a silver (K2 1000 m). At the Flatwater World Championships he won five medals: gold 1985 K2 500 m and 1987 K2 1000 m, silver 1983 K1 500 m, 1987 K2 500 m, and 1990 K2 10000 m.

Paul MacDonald was a key figure in the small but effective New Zealand canoeing force of the 1980s. He won three Olympic gold medals plus a silver and a bronze and won three world titles. He and Ian Ferguson were a dominant and determined pair at canoeing regattas through the 80s – they won the k2 500m in Los Angeles and Seoul, and combined with Grant Bramwell and Alan Thompson to win the k4 title in 1984. Their careers continued through to the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, when they were still good enough to make the final of the k2 1000m. MacDonald took over the k1 from Ferguson in 1987 when he won the world title and he was third at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. MacDonald also represented New Zealand in surf lifesaving and captained a world surf lifesaving team in 1985.

A lifetime of achievementBy the time she graduated from her army sports boarding school, Fischer was already the youngest champion in the history of Olympic kayaking. She had won gold in the K1 500m at the 1980 Moscow Games aged just 20, setting the tone for her incredible career.


Olympic dominance


Fischer dominated the sport with an amazing run of victories. She won the World Championship in 1981, 1982 and 1983, only missing out at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games due to East Germany’s boycott.


Six Olympic golds


Despite being beaten in the singles final in Seoul in 1998, she won gold in the pairs hours later, and took gold in the fours the next day. She continued with singles gold and fours silver in Barcelona in 1992, then fours gold and pairs silver in Atlanta in 1996. In 2000, in Sydney, Fischer won yet another two golds in the fours and pairs.


Record holder


In Athens in 2004, Birgit came out of retirement for one last performance. Aged 42, she won the gold in the fours (K-4 500m) and silver in the double (K-2 500m). With 12, she is kayaking’s leading medal winner, and only Larissa Latynina (in artistic gymnastics) has won more Olympic medals. Fischer is also the only woman to win Olympic medals 20 years apart.

In 1988, Vanya Gesheva became the first Bulgarian Olympian to win a complete set of Olympic medals. She combined a victory in the K-1 with a silver medal in the K-2 (together with Diana Paliyska) and a bronze medal in the K-4. Gesheva had débuted at the Olympics in Moscow, where she had earned a silver medal in the K-1 500 m, behind Birgit Fischer. A silver medallist at the 1983 World Championships, Gesheva missed the 1984 Olympics when Bulgaria joined the Eastern Bloc boycott. In 1986, with the dominant Fischer absent, Gesheva won her first international title, claiming the K-1 world title. At the Seoul Olympics, Schmidt did compete, but surprisingly lost to Gesheva in the final, by a narrow margin of just 0.12 seconds. Earlier in her career, Gesheva had also collected World Championship medals in the K-2 500 m (bronze in 1977 with the non-Olympian Diana Khristova and in 1986 with Diana Paliyska) and K-4 500 m (silver in 1978 with Natasha Petrova and the non-Olympians Velichka Mincheva and Iliana Nikolova). After her active career, Gesheva became a board member of the Bulgarian canoe federation, and chariman of the canoe section of her club, OSK Levski.

Andy Holmes took up rowing at the age of twelve and, coached by Olympic medalist Jim Clark soon showed a talent for the sport. After leaving school Holmes joined the Leander club and won his first Henley Regatta title, the Thames Challenge Club for club eights, in 1978. Elevated to the national squad in early 1981 Holmes was part of the coxed four that led the 1981 World Championship final for most of the race before fading out of the medal positions. After spending 1982-83 as part of the national eight he switched to the coxless four for the 1984 season. The crew of Holmes, Steven Redgrave, Richard Budgett and Martin Cross, coxed by Adrian Ellison, won the Olympic  title in Los Angeles to become the first British Olympic rowing champions in 36 years and to herald an  upsurge in British rowing that has continued for  the next quarter century.  The gold medal crew quickly broke up and after a quiet 1985 season Holmes and Redgrave decided to form a partnership which thrived on the rivalry between the two men. They met with immediate success and won the world coxed pair title in 1986 then followed this with gold in the coxless pairs and silver in the coxed event in 1987. Holmes and Redgrave attempted the pairs double at the Seoul Olympics and easily won the coxless event. The Italian Abbagnale brothers and the East Germans proved too good in the coxed pairs and, with Pat Sweeney, they placed third.  Holmes also took two gold medals (coxed four and coxless pair) representing England at the 1986 Commonwealth Games.


Following Seoul Holmes walked away from the sport and set up a removals  business but, encouraged his daughter’s entry into the sport, he returned after a twenty year break to become director of rowing of two clubs including one based at the future Olympic rowing venue. In October 2010 he was rushed to hospital and diagnosed as suffering from leptospirosis, also called Weil's disease. Although he appeared to be recovering he had suffered liver and kidney damage which was to prove fatal.

Steven redgrave is widely considered to be the greatest rower of all time, winning gold medals at five successive editions of the olympic games.


FIRST GOLD MEDAL


The extraordinary tally of Redgrave’s Olympic medals started in Los Angeles in 1984. With Martin Cross, Richard Budgett, Andy Holmes and Adrian Ellison, he won the coxed fours event. He continued in partnership with Holmes, winning gold four years later in Seoul in the coxless pairs. 


A NEW PARTNER


After the Games in Seoul, Redgrave teamed up with Matthew Pinsent. They were to become formidable partners, winning gold at the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992. The pair continued to dominate this event and went on to win the following three world championships. At the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996, they had a significant lead of 3.04 seconds halfway through the final race, which they won comfortably. This was their 100th race together. 


PERMISSION TO SHOOT


After his victory in Atlanta, Redgrave announced on television: “Anybody who sees me in a boat has my permission to shoot me.” This did not last long, however. Teaming up this time not only with Pinsent, but also with Cracknell and Foster, he earned a fifth gold medal after a suspense-filled race, in the coxless fours at the Olympic Games Sydney 2000.


THE GREATEST ROWER OF ALL TIME


Steven Redgrave is one of the five Olympians to have won at least one gold medal at five successive editions of the Olympic Games, and is widely considered to be the greatest rower in history.

Pam Shriver turned professional in 1979, shortly after she had stunned the tennis world by making the final of the 1978 US Open shortly after turning 16-years-old. She lost the final in straight sets to Chris Evert but it was a prelude to a great tennis career, although one for which she would become better known in doubles eventually. Shriver’s top world ranking in singles was #3, which she reached in February 1984. She never made the final of a Grand Slam singles event again, although she was a three-time Wimbledon semi-finalist, and won 21 singles titles in her career. At the 1991 Pan American Games, later in her career, Shriver was a triple gold medalist, winning in singles, doubles, and mixed.


In doubles, Shriver was best known for partnering Martina Navratilova. Together they were the top doubles team in the world for most of the 1980s. Shriver won 21 Grand Slam doubles titles, 20 of them with Navratilova, winning seven times at the Australian Open (1982-85, 1987-89), five times at Wimbledon (1981-84, 1986) and the US Open (1983-84, 1986-87, 1991), and four times at the French Open (1984-85, 1987-88), only the 1991 US Open won with another partner (Natasha Zvereva). During her career, Shriver won 112 professional doubles titles, over 80 of them with Navratilova. In 1984 they won the Calendar Grand Slam, winning all four of the major doubles championships. Together they won 10 WTA Year-End Championships, from 1981-89, and 1991.


Shriver later became well known as a tennis broadcaster on television, having worked for ABC, CBS, and ESPN in the United States, the BBC in the United Kingdom, and the Seven Network in Australia. She has been a minority owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, in her hometown. Shriver was married twice, to Joe Shapiro, a former Walt Disney company lawyer who died young from cancer, and then to George Lazenby, best known for once having played the role of James Bond in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.”

Zina Garrison played professional tennis from 1982-97, earning a career high world ranking of #4 in November 1989. Garrison won 14 singles titles during her career. She made the finals at Wimbledon in 1990, and the semi-finals of the US Open in 1988 and 1989. Garrison also played doubles, winning 20 career titles, with a career high world ranking of #5, which she reached in May 1988. She made the doubles finals twice at the Australian Open. Garrison played at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, winning gold in women’s doubles in 1988 (with Pam Shriver) and a bronze that year in women’s singles.


Garrison was the first great African-American female tennis player after Althea Gibson left the scene in the later 1950s. After leaving the tour she founded the Zina Garrison Foundation for the Homeless in 1988 and started the Zina Garrison All-Court Tennis Program in 1992, which supports inner-city tennis in Houston. She also captained the US Federation Cup team in the early 2000s and served as coach of the US women’s team at the 2008 Olympics.

Jana Novotná started out as a well-known doubles player and remained so throughout her career. However, she developed into a top-flight singles player best known for her failures and triumphs at Wimbledon, perfectly exemplifying the words from the Kipling poem that are emblazoned above the All-England Club’s entrance to Centre Court, “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same.”


Novotná reached four Grand Slam singles finals. She lost the final of the 1987 Australian Open to Monica Seles in three sets. In 1993 Novotná reached the Wimbledon final where she faced Steffi Graf. The match went into the third set, which Novotá led 4-1, and had a game point on serve for 5-1, but the pressure overcame her, and Graf won that game and then won the final five games, to win the set, the match, and the tournament. At the victory ceremony, when Novotná was given her runner-up trophy by the Duchess of Kent, she famously cried on the Duchess’s shoulder.


Novotná returned to the Wimbledon final in 1997, but lost again in three sets, that time to Martina Hingis. In 1998, Novotná finally overcame her demons on Centre Court, winning Wimbledon by defeating Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets, in one of the most popular Wimbledon victories ever. She received her trophy, the Venus Rosewater Dish, from the Duchess of Kent. Novotná was the oldest woman in the Open Era to win her first Grand Slam title.


Novotná won 24 professional singles titles in her career but the 1998 Wimbledon was her only Grand Slam, although she did win the 1997 Tour Final. In doubles, she won 12 Grand Slams, and added four Grand Slam titles in mixed doubles. In all, she won 76 doubles titles. She achieved a career best singles rank of #2 in 1997 and had a best doubles rank of #1.


Novotná settled in Florida, doing some tennis commentary on television, until returning to her hometown of Brno in the Czech Republic, eventually building a home in the small neighboring village of Omice, where she lived with her partner. She died very young, at age 49, after a long battle with cancer, which she fought very privately. She was the first women’s Grand Slam champion of the Open Era to pass away.

Early progressIn 1984, Steffi Graf, just 15 years old, won the Olympic tennis demonstration tournament despite being its youngest entrant. By 1987 she was ranked number one in the world. In 1988, Graf won the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and, less than a week before the Seoul Olympic Games, the US Open. This made her only the fifth player in history to win tennis' Grand Slam.


Pioneering victory


She arrived at the Seoul Games on a 35-match winning streak. In the Olympic final, she defeated Argentina’s Gabriela Sabatini 6-3, 6-3 to achieve the first “Golden Slam” – all five Grand Slam titles plus the Olympic gold medal. No one in women’s tennis has achieved it since. 


Retiring at the top


Graf retired in 1999 while still number three in the world, having dominated the sport for over a decade. In the same year she was awarded the Olympic Order.

A descendant of Danish sailors, Brazil’s Torben Grael honoured his maritime roots at six editions of the Olympic Games, winning five medals.


Sailing DNA


Born in Sao Paulo of Danish descent, Torben Grael hailed from a rich sailing tradition. He was introduced to the water when he was just five, taken under the wing of his grandfather Preben Schmidt - one of the pioneers of Brazilian sailing - and his uncles, Erik and Axel Preben-Schmidt , who represented Brazil at the Olympic Games in 1968 ad 1972. They took him out on Aileen, a 6m class vessel, which had been used at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, by Denmark’s silver medal-winning crew of Herschend, Meulengracht and Thomsen. After his family relocated to Niteroi, opposite Rio de Janeiro in Guanabara Bay, Torben and his younger brother Lars began competing. Together they won the world junior title in the Snipe class in 1978, going on to lift the senior title in the same class in 1983 and 1987. The two brothers competed together for the best part of a decade, before deciding to go their separate ways (Lars would go on to win two Olympic bronze medals in the Snipe class in 1988 and 1996).


Six Games, five medals 


Grael made his Olympic debut at Los Angeles 1984, at the age of 24, when he competed with Ronaldo Senft and Daniel Adler in the Soling class. The trio won silver behind the USA. Four years later in Seoul he was back on Olympic waters, this time in the Star class with Nelson Falcao, and the pair claimed bronze. Grael then began a long partnership with Marcelo Ferreira in the Star. It would eventually develop into a fruitful association, but at Barcelona 1992, they could do no better than 11th place. Then came three successive podium finishes - gold at Atlanta 1996, bronze at Sydney 2000, and gold again at Athens 2004. Grael’s tally of five Olympic medals set a new record, though at London 2012 was equalled by his compatriot Robert Scheidt, and Great Britain’s Ben Ainslie.


Sailor of the Seven Seas


Grael’s uncanny ability to get the most out of his vessel regardless of the weather conditions earned him the nickname of “Turbine”. Away from the Olympic Games, he competed in the Americas Cup on three occasions, either as tactician or a member of the afterguard. In 2000, he was part of the Italian Prada team that challenged Team New Zealand for the trophy, and in 2007 he was part of the Luna Rossa crew that lost the final of the Louis Vuitton Cup - the event to decide the identity of the challenger in the America’s Cup. He twice skippered crews in the the Volvo Ocean Race, navigating Brasil 1 to third place in 2005-2006 before winning the race in 2008-2009. Chosen to carry the flag for the Brazilian team at Athens 2004, Grael was named ISAF World Sailor of the Year in 2009, and, despite hailing from a country where football dominates, he is regarded as one of Brazil’s greatest sporting figures. He once said: “The boat isn’t important, it’s all about the knowledge of the sailor.” Grael certainly had enough to last him a lifetime.

Frank McLaughlin and his brother Terry took up sailing at the Royal Canadian Yacht Club and, in 1984, were both selected to represent Canada at that year’s Summer Olympics. Terry won a silver medal in the Flying Dutchman class while Frank, with Martin Tenhove, finished 15th in the 470 event. They following year Frank partnered with John Millen, switched to the Flying Dutchman class, and placed second at the European Championships. In 1986 they came in third at both the World Championships and the Goodwill Games and, a year later, won the Canadian Olympic trials after finishing first in seven of the nine races. After a fifth-place finish at the 1988 World Championships, the Canadians took on the Summer Games and were fourth after the sixth, and penultimate, race. They won the final event, however, while third-ranked New Zealand came in tenth and dropped below both Canada and Israel, giving the McLaughlin and Millen the bronze medal.


After the Games, McLaughlin shifted focus to his law career, having graduated from the University of Toronto’s law school earlier that year. He continued sailing, however, and was selected in 1992 (along with Millen) to represent Canada once more at the Olympics.

John Millen and Frank McLaughlin were childhood friends who learned to sail together, but it was not until 1985 that they paired up in the Flying Dutchman class for international competition. By then McLaughlin had already attended the 1984 Summer Olympics, while Millen had been the International 14 class World Champion in 1981. After placing second at the 1985 European Championships, they came in third at the 1986 World Championships and Goodwill Games before finishing first at the 1987 Canadian Olympic trials, winning seven of the nine races. Although they slipped to fifth at the 1988 World Championships, they managed to capture bronze at that year’s Summer Games. They were fourth after the sixth, and penultimate, event in the tournament, but reached the podium by winning the final race while the team above them, from New Zealand, dropped down two spots following a 10th-place finish. The duo made one more Olympic appearance, ninth at the 1992 Games, before McLaughlin retired from active competition to pursue a career in law. Millen, as of 2013, continues to compete internationally for Canada.

Chen Jing is the only Olympian to have won Olympic medals for both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, which competes as Chinese Taipei at the Olympics. When table tennis débuted at the Olympics in 1988, the Chinese did not field their highest ranked players, giving Chen a chance at a medal. She waltzed through the field, not losing a single game until the final, in which she defeated fellow Chinese Li Huifen, 3-2. She picked up a second medal in the doubles, winning silver with Jiao Zhimin, the individual bronze medallist. Chen also won four medals at the 1989 World Championships, bronze in the singles, silver in the doubles, bronze in the mixed doubles, and gold with the Chinese team. It would be her final medals competing for the People's Republic. In 1991, she started training in Taiwan, and settled there the following year. She won her first international prize at the 1993 Worlds, earning a silver. In Atlanta, she competed for her new nation, and defeated favorite Qiao Hong to reach the final. There she played the defending champion, Deng Yaping. The match was interrupted at 2-0 for Deng, as a Taiwanese supporter carrying the national flag – not allowed by IOC rules as the nation competes as Chinese Taipei – was removed by police. Chen then rallied to tie the game at 2-2, but eventually lost 3-2. In Sydney, 2000, she would again medal, earning a bronze to gain a full collection of Olympic medals. Chen, also a medallist at the 1997 (mixed doubles) and 2000 Worlds (team), retired after the Sydney Games. She has since completed her studies as a sports psychologist, and has returned to the Chinese mainland to work for the national table tennis team.

From a young age, Sue Holloway’s ambition was to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics, a dream that she achieved in 1976, when she was only 21 years old. Her primary sport was canoeing and, having joined the national team in 1973, she had finished seventh in the K1-500 and the K2-500 at the 1974 World Championships, also failing to medal the following year. She was, however, the Canadian champion in the K1-500, the K2-500, and the K4-500 in 1975 and was selected to represent her nation at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Her first stop, however, was the Winter edition, where she placed 32nd in the 10 kilometer cross country race and 7th (alongside Joan Groothuysen, Sharon Firth, and Shirley Firth) in the 4 x 5 kilometer relay. At the Summer Games she was eliminated in the opening round of the K1-500 and finished eighth in the K2-500 with Anne Dodge. In the latter, Dodge was a last-minute replacement for the non-Olympian Karen Tippett, who had helped Holloway win four consecutive national championships in the K2-500.


Holloway focused on canoeing after 1976, with the intent of making the 1980 Olympic team, but her hopes were shattered when Canada joined the boycott of these Games (although, prior to this announcement, she had been selected as the nation’s flag bearer in the Opening Ceremony). Refusing to give up hope, she continued to train and made Canada’s delegation to the 1984 Summer Olympics, where she captured bronze in the K4-500, alongside Alexandra Barré, Lucie Guay, and Barb Olmsted, and silver in the K2-500 with Barré. Holloway retired shortly after the Games and, with degrees in teaching and physical education from the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, and George Brown College, she took up coaching, sports management, human resources, and motivational speaking. She also spent many years working with the Canadian Olympic Committee and has been inducted into the Canadian Olympic (1986), Ottawa Sports (1986), and Brookfield High School Sports (2008) Halls of Fame.

Although the 47-year-old champion kayaker retired after finishing the K1 competition without a medal, her incredible achievement rounded off a long and spectacular career that has seen her compete for both West Germany and Italy.


Idem, who saw off competition from rivals less than half her age, made it to the final at Eton Dorney. Her success is testament to the fact that she still trains for four gruelling hours every day, despite having two children and after racking up four decades of competitive sport.


Since taking up sprint canoeing in 1977, she has amassed five Olympic medals, including a gold at the 2000 Games in Sydney, and a total of 35 international titles.


Born in West Germany, she became an Italian citizen by marriage in 1990 and is the first woman from her adopted country to win both world championship and Olympic titles in canoe sprint.


Idem began paddling at the age of 11, and two years later, in 1977, she took gold over 200m, 500m and 1,000m at the European Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, as well as bronze in doubles kayaking. It was the beginning of a glittering career on the water.


At Los Angeles in 1984, she won a bronze medal in the K-2 500m with Barbara Schüttpelz before switching to individual events. Four years later in Seoul, she could muster only ninth place in the K-1 500m and fifth in the fours.


But a new coach, Gugliemo Guerrini, whom she later married, brought success. Their partnership immediately reaped rewards, with Idem winning two bronze medals at the World Championships in 1989.


She competed under the Italian flag at the 1992 Barcelona Games, placing fourth – then won bronze in the 500m event at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.


Over the course of the next six years, she won three world championship titles, along with 10 silver and bronze medals, five European titles. Then came the breakthrough, when she took gold in Sydney.


After taking time out to have a child, she returned to the sport at Athens in 2004 and won a silver medal in the K-1 500m event.


At Beijing in 2008, her seventh Olympic appearance, she won a fifth medal, the silver in K-1 500m, after being pipped at the post and losing in a photo-finish.


After making it to the K1 final in London, Idem gave a hint of the dedication that goes into becoming an Olympic champion. She said: “Every day you have to work on your motivation. You always have to think about it. You go out really tired, you go out with bad weather, you go out with problems at home. But you have to go. This is it – the effort you have to put in if you want to succeed. I am very lucky. Many people do the same amount of work as I do and they don't go to the Olympics so my motivation comes from the fact that I was lucky and I was good all these years.”


Her Olympic career is now over, but Idem has promised to be at Rio in 2016 – as a journalist covering the Games.

When Ian Ferguson first competed at an Olympic Games in 1976 and even again when he was one of the tiny team in Moscow in 1980, few would have seen him as one of New Zealand's greatest sportsmen. Yet that's what he became – two gold medals (K1 and K2 500 m) in one day in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984, then another the next day (K4 1000 m). Four years later, in Seoul, there was another gold medal (K2 500 m), plus a silver (K2 1000 m). At the Flatwater World Championships he won five medals: gold 1985 K2 500 m and 1987 K2 1000 m, silver 1983 K1 500 m, 1987 K2 500 m, and 1990 K2 10000 m. In all the K2 events he partnered with Paul MacDonald. Ferguson also won gold and silver competing for New Zealand in surf lifesaving. A son, Steven Ferguson, competed in swimming at the 2000 Games and in kayaking in 2004 and 2008.

Paul MacDonald was a key figure in the small but effective New Zealand canoeing force of the 1980s. He won three Olympic gold medals plus a silver and a bronze and won three world titles. He and Ian Ferguson were a dominant and determined pair at canoeing regattas through the 80s – they won the k2 500m in Los Angeles and Seoul, and combined with Grant Bramwell and Alan Thompson to win the k4 title in 1984. Their careers continued through to the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, when they were still good enough to make the final of the k2 1000m. MacDonald took over the k1 from Ferguson in 1987 when he won the world title and he was third at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. MacDonald also represented New Zealand in surf lifesaving and captained a world surf lifesaving team in 1985.

Following the Games Fisher entered medical school, but this did not stop the duo from qualifying for the 1988 Summer Olympics, where they were eliminated in the semifinals of the K2-500. Fisher retired from active competition shortly after, but made a brief comeback in the early 1990s in an attempt to qualify for the 1992 Games. When he failed to do so, he retired for good and became a practicing physician, although he also found time to take on coaching at the provincial level.

Chris Timms sailed for New Zealand at both the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, winning two medals, including a gold in 1984. His sporting career began as a mountain climber, but in 1966 he was badly injured in a fall off the Tasman Glacier. He then took up competitive sailing after spending several months in traction. Timms was a resin chemist and was a co-founder of Adhesive Technologies, which worked in resin manufacturing and engineering for marine usage. Many of their products were used in America’s Cup competition. Timms tragically was killed when he was flying in a two-seater plane that crashed in the Firth of Thames off the North Island of New Zealand.

Born in Venezuela, Evert Bastet moved to Quebec in 1955 and took up sailing at the age of nine. His first competition came two years later and his first victory, in the Flying Dutchman class at the Canadian Junior Championships, arrived in 1965. Three years later he was an alternate on Canada's team at the 1968 Summer Olympics, although he did not take part in Roger and Stewart Green's seventh-place finish. He did compete at the next two editions, however, finishing 15th and 4th with Don Andrews and Peter Byrne, and Hans Fogh respectively. He also won the 1976 European Championships with Fogh, in addition to bronze at the 1974 World Championships. After winning the 1980 World Championships alongside Terry McLaughlin, he was selected for that year's Summer Olympics, which Canada boycotted, and then won a silver medal at the 1984 Games with McLaughlin. The duo also came in third at the 1982 World Championships.


Bastet was named to two more Canadian Olympic teams, but did not compete in Frank McLaughlin and John Millen's bronze medal-winning effort in 1988 or their ninth-place finish in 1992. He eventually retired to concentrate on his work with E. B. Spars, the company that he founded in 1976, in addition to officiating, coaching, and managing national teams. He has been inducted into the Canadian Olympic (1994), Quebec Sports (2006), and Quebec Sailing (2010) Halls of Fame and also helped carry the Olympic torch on its way to the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. The Quebec Sailing Federation's Evert Bastet Trophy, given annually to an exceptional sailor from the province, is named in his honor.

One of Canada’s most accomplished sailors, Terry McLaughlin had his best competitive years in the 1980s. After winning the 1980 World Championships in the Flying Dutchman class with Evert Bastet, he was selected to represent Canada at that year’s Summer Olympics, but stayed home after his country boycotted those Games. In 1983 he skipped Canada I, the nation’s entry into that year’s Louis Vuitton Cup, which determines the challenger for the America’s Cup. The following year he and Bastet were again chosen for the Summer Olympics, where they won a silver medal. This was arguably the pinnacle of McLaughlin’s sailing career although, as of 2013, he still competes in numerous regattas every year with the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. Most notably, he has won Canada’s prestigious York Cup five times. His brother Frank was a bronze medalist in the Flying Dutchman class at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Terry McLaughlin returned many years later to win a silver medal in J/24 Class at the 2015 Pan American Games.

A winning team


At the age of nineteen, she debuted at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, where she teamed with Marioara Popescu to win the double sculls final. In 1988, she earned a silver medal in the same event, this time with Veronica Cogeanu as her partner. Lipa and Cogeanu also won bronze medals in the quadruple sculls without coxswain. In 1992, Lipa, who made her living working for the Romanian equivalent of the CIA, and Cogeanu (now known as Veronica Cochela) repeated their second place finish in the double sculls. The next day, Lipa led the single sculls from start to finish to earn her second career gold medal.


A gold medal at 35 years old


At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, she placed ninth in the single sculls, but then won another gold medal as a member of Romania's coxed eight with coxswain crew. With this race, she became the first rower in Olympic history to win six medals. Lipa competed in her fifth edition of the Games in 2000 at the age of 35. At the Games in Sydney she helped Romania defend its title in the eights, thus becoming the oldest oarswoman to win a gold medal in the eight with coxswain event at the Olympic Games.

Silken Laumann is the greatest female rower ever produced by Canada. Her brilliant career has lacked only an individual sculling gold medal, but her failure to win gold at the 1992 Olympics may have been her finest moment in sport.


Laumann began her sports career as a runner but at age 17 turned to rowing along with her older sister, Danièle. They quickly advanced to the Canadian national team, and in 1984 at Los Angeles, teamed to win a bronze medal in the Olympic double sculls. After Danielle retired from the sport, Silken Laumann continued with other partners and began to scull a single as well. In 1985, she finished 4th at the World Championships in the single sculls. After a single sculls gold medal at the 1987 Pan-American Games, she returned to the doubles for the 1988 Olympics at Seoul, finishing 7th with Kay Worthington.


After the 1988 Olympics, Silken Laumann focused almost exclusively on the single sculls. She finished 7th at the 1989 World Championships and progressed to 2nd in 1990, before winning the singles World Championship in 1991. She dominated women’s sculling in that year, also winning international titles at Lucerne, San Diego, and Hazelwinkel (BEL) as part of the World Cup. With the 1992 Olympics on the horizon, Silken Laumann was the heavy favorite to win the gold medal in single sculls at Barcelona.


But shortly before the Barcelona Olympics, training at a lake in Essen, Germany on 16 May 1992, her dreams were shattered. Another scull and she collided and the impact drove a piece of the splashboard into Laumann’s leg. She sustained an open tibia fracture, with concurrent nerve damage, which permanently weakened her leg. She also lost skin and soft tissue that required multiple operations. She noted that “The muscles on the outside of my right leg were peeled back and hanging down to the ankle … the doctors thought I would never row again.” Her gold medal plans seemed doomed but she refused to quit. Pushing herself into rehab, she determined to compete at Barcelona, even if she was at less than her previous dominant self, “I will not forget getting back into the shell. I love the sport so much, but I didn’t fully realize it until I got out there. I just sat in the boat for a time, pushed off the dock, then started to cry. It was wonderful.”Laumann did not win the single sculls at Barcelona, but she did medal, finishing 3rd behind her arch-rival, Romania’s Elisabeta Lipa. Olympic chronicler, Bud Greenspan, said it best, “Canada won four gold medals and one bronze medal in rowing at Lake Banyoles. Let the word go out that on this day the bronze medal shone as brightly in the Barcelona sun as any of the gold.”Laumann’s career did not end at Barcelona. Still with nerve and muscle damage to her injured leg, she finished 2nd at the Worlds in 1995 in the singles, and repeated that finish for an Olympic silver medal at Atlanta in 1996 before retiring. But it was her courageous performance at Barcelona for which she will always be best remembered.

Betty Craig took up rowing in 1973 and was a rising star on the Canadian scene in the mid-1970s. She began her long international career with a trip to the 1976 Summer Olympics, where she was fifth in the coxless pairs alongside Tricia Smith. She won bronze and silver with Susan Antoft at the 1977 and 1978 World Championships respectively, and then finished seventh with a coxed fours crew consisting of Craig, Monika Draeger, and the non-Olympians Catherine Burke, Iona Mahtab, and Ilona Smith at the 1979 World Championships. This was her only departure from the coxless pairs at a major international tournament. She was selected to compete at the 1980 Summer Olympics, but stayed home after Canada joined the boycott of those Games. The following year she renewed her partnership with Smith and the duo went on to capture silver, bronze, and bronze at the 1981, 1982, and 1983 World Championships respectively. Their greatest achievement, however, came in 1984 when they earned silver in the event at the Summer Olympics, behind Rodica Arba-Puşcatu and Elena Oprea-Horvat of Romania. Craig retired after the Games, but returned with Smith in 1987 and won the Canadian Championships. After an eighth-place finishing at that year’s World Championships, however, Craig retired for good. As of 2010 she lives and works on a farm in British Columbia, taking care of horses and training riders. She was made a member of the Brockville and District Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

After a short swimming career at the national level, Tricia Smith became involved in rowing at the age of 16 and quickly became a star on the Canadian scene, winning five national championships between 1974 and 1982. She made her international debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics, where she placed fifth in the coxless pairs with Betty Craig, and then spent the next three years as a member of a coxed eights crew, finishing third, third, and fifth at the World Championships from 1977 through 1979. She returned to the coxless pairs, and Craig, in 1980 and was selected for that year’s Summer Olympics, but stayed home after Canada joined the boycott of those Games.  Undeterred, the duo earned silver, bronze, and bronze at the next three editions of the World Championships and then took their talents to the 1984 Summer Olympics, where they won silver behind Rodica Arba-Puşcatu and Elena Oprea-Horvat of Romania.


Craig left active competition after the Games and Smith joined a coxed fours crew that took bronze medals at the 1985 and 1986 World Championships. She also won the event at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, alongside Christine Clarke, Lesley Thompson-Willie, Jane Tregunno, and Jennifer Walinga. In 1987 Craig came out of retirement and the duo won the Canadian Championships once more. After an eighth-place finish at that year’s World Championships, however, Craig bowed out again and Smith returned to the coxed fours, in which she placed seventh at the 1988 Summer Olympics (with Thompson-Willie, Tregunno, Walinga, and Heather Clarke).


Smith retired after the Games and, having earned a law degree from the University of British Columbia in 1985, became a practicing attorney. Her affiliation with the sports world, however, did not end. After many years with UBC’s Athletic Committee and the International Federation of Rowing Associations, she was selected for the Canadian Olympic Committee’s (COC) executive board in 2005, having been involved with them since 1980. In 2007 she served as the Chef de Mission for Canada’s delegation to the Pan American Games and became a vice-president of the COC in 2009. She has also erved on the board of the International Council of Arbitration for Sport and, in 2016, became the head of the Canadian Olympic Committee. With her predecessor, Marcel Aubut, having resigned following complaints of sexual harassment, Smith declared her intent to reform the Committee’s institutional culture. Being named as a Member of the Order of Canada (2010) and the Order of British Columbia (2012), an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from UBC (2001), and induction into the British Columbia Sports (1992), the University of British Columbia Sports (1994), and Canadian Olympic (2000) Halls of Fame are among her many honors. She also remains a partner at Barnes Craig & Associates in Vancouver. In June 2016, Smith was invited to become a member of the IOC.

As he could not qualify for the 1980 Moscow Olympics in decathlon Schauerhammer switched to bobsledding. His best year was 1984, winning two Olympic gold medals in both bob events with pilot Wolfgang Hoppe. The four-man bob was elected 1984 team of the year in the former GDR.

East German bobsledder Bernhard Lehmann won a gold medal as the brakeman at the 1976 Winter Olympics in the four-man bob with pilot Meinhard Nehmer, Bernhard Germashausen and Jochen Babock. Formed with a backbone of converted track and field athletes the GDR had threatened to break through to the podium positions over the previous seasons and in Innsbruck this was achieved in spectacular fashion, when they won over the favored bobs from West Germany, Switzerland and Austria. This four-man team also won the World Championships that same year. Eight years later Lehmann piloted his own bobs with brakeman Bogdan Musiol and won two silver medals at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, while in 1988 he added a bronze medal to his collection in the two-man event with Mario Hoyer. In 1983 Lehmann also won a gold medal at the European Championships in the two-man, adding a silver medal in 1986. At the World Championships he won silver in the 1982 four-man and won the title in that event in 1985.


As his father Helmut was a well-known handball coach, Bernhard’s first love was handball before he changed to bobsledding. He moved to Winterberg after German reunification and worked as the regional coach of Northrhine-Westfalia, where he coached among others Sandra Kiriasis.

Russian domination broken


At the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Games, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of Nottingham, England, won the ice dance competition. This was the first time that the competition had been won by a non-Russian couple.


Ravel’s Bolero


The British couple mesmerised the world with their breathtaking interpretation of Maurice Ravel’s Bolero. The judges awarded them 12 scores of 6.0 out of 18 marks, including across-the-board perfect scores for artistic impression.


Clever timing


The couple managed to present their 4-minute 28-second dance despite the fact that the time limit was 4 minutes 10 seconds. They did this by moving their bodies to the music for 18 seconds before they started skating.


Bronze return


Torvill and Dean returned to the Olympic Games in 1994. However, they could not match the astonishing performance they had produced ten years earlier and finished in bronze medal position.

With nine participations, Hubert Raudaschl held the absolute record for competing in the most Olympics from 1996 until 2012, when Ian Millar appeared in his 10th edition. The number could have been even higher, as he was present at the 1960 Olympics as an 18-year-old. He was, however, only a substitute for the Austrian sailing team there. In 1964 he started his Olympic career in the Finn class, finishing 5th, improving to silver in Mexico. He then switched from the solo vessels to two- and three-person boats. After the Tempest (1972) and the Soling (1976, together with his brother Walter), he settled for the Star class. He competed in that boat from 1980 to 1996, getting his best finish in 1980. Together with Karl Ferstl he again won a silver medal. It could have been gold, had they not been (controversially) disqualified in the third race, which they won. In his long Olympic career, Raudaschl also carried the Austrian flag four times during opening ceremonies, which is also a record. Following his last Olympic competition in 1996, he has focused on working in the family business, a sail factory. His son Florian attempted to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Finn competitions, but had to wait until 2012 to follow in his father's footsteps.

Bernhard Germeshausen won the two-man bob in 1976 with his compatriot Meinhard Nehmer, and they were both members of the winning four-man crew in 1976 and 1980. 1976 their bob was formed from a backbone of converted track and field athletes the GDR had threatened to break through to the podium positions over the previous seasons and in Innsbruck this was achieved in spectacular fashion. Therefore they were able to defeat the favored bobs from West Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The three Olympic gold medals they each won stand as the current Olympic record for bobsledding. Germeshausen also won silver in the two-man event at the 1980 Olympics (partnering Hans-Jürgen Gerhardt), and he was the winner at the World Championships in the two-man in 1981 (with Gerhardt) and in the four-man in 1977 and 1981.

After his first Olympic victory Pattisson resigned his commission in the Navy and joined a boat building firm in Dorset, which allowed him more time for training than his naval duties had permitted. He consolidated his position as the world's leading helmsman in the Flying Dutchman class and was the world and European champion from 1968 to 1972.

At the 1974 trials, he served as helmsman for two boats (at separate times) in the defender trials. Neither boat was chosen, but in 1980, Conner skippered the boat Freedom as she defended the Cup by defeating the Australian challenger, winning four of five races. In 1983, Conner was again chosen to defend the Cup, this time skippering the boat Liberty. Sadly Conner suffered the ignominy of losing the Cup to a faster boat, Australia ll, for the first U.S. loss in the 132-year history of the event.

Although he began his career as a track and field athlete, Erich Schärer eventually found his greatest sporting love in bobsledding. His first major success came at the 1971 World Championships, where he won the four-man alongside Max Forster, René Stadler, and the non-Olympian Peter Schärer. With Werner Camichel replacing Forster, the quartet came in third at the 1973 European Championships, but defended their crown at that year’s World Championships. Sepp Benz then took Stadler’s spot and the foursome captured the 1975 World Championships and came in third at the 1976 European Championships. Erich and Peter Schärer, meanwhile, took gold in the two-man at that year’s European Championships. Erich and Benz also attended the 1976 Winter Olympics, where they earned a bronze medal in the two-man and, with Ueli Bächli and Ruedi Marti, silver in the four-man.


This new quartet took silver at the 1977 and 1978 World Championships and, with the non-Olympian Hansjörg Trachsel temporarily replacing Marti, bronze at the 1979 edition. Schärer, Bächli, Trachsel and the non-Olympian Max Rüegg also captured silver at the 1979 European Championships. In the two-man event, Schärer and Benz won the 1978 and 1979 World Championships, while Schärer and Bächli earned silver and bronze at the 1979 and 1980 European Championships respectively. Marti returned to the four-man team and helped them win the 1980 European Championships and take silver at that year’s Winter Olympics. Schärer and Benz, meanwhile, captured Olympic gold in the two-man.


Schärer continued his success over the next few years. At the 1981 World Championships he and Benz came in third in both the two- and four-man events, the latter with Max and non-Olympian Tony Rüegg. Schärer earned his final European Championship medal, gold, with Max Rüegg in 1982, and together they won the event at that year’s World Championships. With Tony and non-Olympian Franz Isenegger, the duo also captured bronze in the four-man. Schärer won silver in the two-man with Max Rüegg at the 1983 World Championships, and his final major international medal came at the 1986 World Championships, where he won the four-man alongside Erwin Fassbind, Kurt Meier, and the non-Olympian André Kisser.

On each of his three Olympic appearances, he sailed with a different crew but won a medal on each occasion. Pattisson's first major success came in 1960 when as a 17-year-old he won the world cadet title, with his brother John crewing. In 1968 he won the world and European titles before going on to win an Olympic gold medal with Iain MacDonald-Smith. A second gold followed in 1972 with Christopher Davies as his partner and in 1976 Pattisson took the silver medal with Julian Brooke-Houghton. He was awarded the MBE for his Olympic successes. After his first Olympic victory Pattisson resigned his commission in the Navy and joined a boat building firm in Dorset, which allowed him more time for training than his naval duties had permitted. He consolidated his position as the world's leading helmsman in the Flying Dutchman class and was the world and European champion from 1968 to 1972. Pattisson built his success on meticulous attention to detail and a dedication to physical fitness; he came closed to making the Olympic team for a fourth time in 1984 in his favorite Flying Dutchman class.

West-Berlin based sailor Willi Kuhweide became one of the most successful sailors ever in Germany. He participated in five Olympic Games from 1964-84, only missing 1980 because of the US-led boycott.


At his first Olympic appearance in 1964, Kuhweide was the object of Cold War intrigue between the NOCs of the former GDR and FRG. He had lost the inter-national races against GDR sailor Bernd Dehmel, but was the reigning European champion (because GDR sailors had not received an entry permit to come to Denmark). The International Yachting Union IYRU then ordered a race-off in Japan at Enoshima Island on Sagami Bay before the Games, but Dehmel refused to participate. Per the IOC, both sailors should have competed in the first four regattas, with the loser eliminated, but the IYRU did not agree with this. Kuhweide was asked to withdraw by the East German NOC, but the West Germans would not accept this. With only an hour before the first regatta, IOC president Avery Brundage chose Kuhweide for the regatta, who then won the gold medal in the Finn Monotype class.


Four years later at Acapulco Kuhweide finished a disappointing 15th. He then moved to the Star class and won a bronze medal in 1972 at Kiel with Karsten Meyer. Another four years later, then sailing in Soling class, he finished sixth at Ontario Lake. Finally, he came back in 1984, again in Soling, and finished eighth at Long Beach, near Los Angeles. At Los Angeles, he was also the flagbearer for West Germany at the Opening Ceremony. Kuhweide also won four World and three European Championships. He also had 10 wins at Kiel Week and eight West German championships.


Kuhweide emigrated in 1983 to Küssnacht in Switzerland. By profession, he first started a career as a military pilot with the West German Bundeswehr. He then became a civilian pilot with Lufthansa. After his retirement as a pilot he became a pilot trainer and moved to Phoenix, Arizona in the United States, where he headed the Lufthansa civilian flying school from 1989 until his retirement. In 2011 he was admitted to the German Sports Hall of Fame.

John Nunn graduated from Cornell, following in his father’s footsteps, who had played lacrosse and football at Cornell, before playing professional football with the Boston Shamrocks of the American Football League. John Nunn rowed on a winning junior varsity eight at the Eastern Sprints while at Cornell, and helped Cornell win the IRA title in 1962 and 1963, but it was after college that he really blossomed as a rower. In 1967 Nunn won the national association single sculls and took a silver medal in that event at the Pan American Games. The following year he teamed with Bill Maher to win the Olympic bronze at Mexico City. In 1971 he again rowed in the doubles, this time with Tom McKibbon at the Pan-Am Games, and they won a bronze medal together. After college, Nunn earned an MBA at Michigan and later set up his own business, which sold fabricated metals and packaged products to the aerospace industry. He also served as the sculling coach for the USA rowers at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Nunn is a member of the Cornell University Athletic Hall of Fame.

Rodney Pattisson ranked as Britain's most successful Olympic yachtsman until he was surpassed by Ben Ainslie in 2008. On each of his three Olympic appearances, he sailed with a different crew but won a medal on each occasion. Pattisson's first major success came in 1960 when as a 17-year-old he won the world cadet title, with his brother John crewing. In 1968 he won the world and European titles before going on to win an Olympic gold medal with Iain MacDonald-Smith. A second gold followed in 1972 with Christopher Davies as his partner and in 1976 Pattisson took the silver medal with Julian Brooke-Houghton. He was awarded the MBE for his Olympic successes. After his first Olympic victory Pattisson resigned his commission in the Navy and joined a boat building firm in Dorset, which allowed him more time for training than his naval duties had permitted. He consolidated his position as the world's leading helmsman in the Flying Dutchman class and was the world and European champion from 1968 to 1972. Pattisson built his success on meticulous attention to detail and a dedication to physical fitness; he came closed to making the Olympic team for a fourth time in 1984 in his favorite Flying Dutchman class. Despite his domination of this class, Rodney Pattisson was a versatile sailor and in 1983 was co-skipper of Victory, Peter de Savary's entry for the America's Cup.

Olympic medals


At the 1956 Cortina Winter Games, Eugenio Monti earned silver medals in both the two-man and the four-man bobsleigh events. In 1960, the bobsled event was omitted from the Olympic programme. But the event returned four years later in Innsbruck and Monti won two bronze medals. By 1968, Monti had won nine World Championships and four Olympic medals, but no Olympic golds.


True sportsman


At the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Games, Monti also showed great sportsmanship. He helped his rivals Tony Nash and Robin Dixon win gold medals when he loaned them an axle bolt to replace one that had broken. The International Fair Play Committee rewarded Monti’s sportsmanship with the highest possible honour, the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Trophy.


Golden finale


Aged 40, Monti knew that the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games would be his last chance to win an Olympic title. Fired up, he claimed gold medals in both the two-man and four-man events. It was a memorable way for him to cap a colourful Olympic career.

Like several other successful Italian bobsledders, Luciano De Paolis was a non-commissioned officer in the Italian Air Force and was selected for the bob team after performing tests among track and field athletes with good speed. At Grenoble in 1968, he was a two-time Olympic champion in the two- and four-man bobsled in the crews of pilot Eugenio Monti. After Monti retired, De Paolis won gold in the four-man at the 1969 European Championships with Alberto Frigo. He was also a member of the crew that won gold in the four-man event at the 1970 World Championships with Nevio de Zordo as pilot. In 1972, De Paolis competed at a second Winter Olympics and carried the Italian flag at the Opening Ceremony. With Italia II in the four-man bob of Gianfranco Gaspari he had to settle for eighth place. In the same year, the team was ranked second at the Military World Championships. Interestingly, De Paolis never did better than third place in the Italian Championships. He received the Italian Fair Play Award in 2009, with his teammate Mario Armano, in memory of Eugenio Monti.

The following year, Panțuru claimed a silver medal at the World Championships in Lake Placid, with Dumitru Focşeneanu as a brakeman. However, he lost this medal in an American car while hitchhiking to the airport. The medal was found in a basement 30 years later, and was returned to Panțuru. His last international medal was won at the 1973 World Championships, when Panțuru and Focşeneanu placed third.

Three-time Olympian Klaus-Michael Bonsack was the East German flagbearer at the 1972 Sapporo Olympics. He was one of the most successful East German lugers winning four Olympic medals: one gold in 1968 with Thomas Köhler in the doubles, one silver in the 1964 singles, and two bronzes – in the 1968 singles and in 1972 with Wolfram Fiedler in doubles. Bonsack also won five World Championship medals with one gold (doubles in 1967), two silvers (doubles in 1965, singles in 1967), and two bronzes (singles in 1963, doubles in 1969), and also won 11 East German Championships. 


After his retirement he studied at the engineering high school at Schmalkalden and found a job at the scientific centre of the East German bobsleigh federation. After German reunification he became a coach for the Austrian Luging Federation where he coached, among others, the sisters Doris and Angelika Neuner. Bonsack later served as chairman of the track construction commission, approving the final homologation of Cesana Pariol prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics at Torino for luge. He was among the first three inductees in the FIL Hall of Fame in 2004, along with Paul Hildgartner and Margit Schumann.

Manfred Schmid was born in Liezen, Styria in the middle of Austria. After using a luge every winter to go to school he became a member of WSV Liezen at the age of 12. His first top results came in doubles, when he twice won the European Junior Championships, in 1960 and 1962, with different partners. Schmid competed in four consecutive Olympics starting in 1964, but his greatest success came at the 1968 Games, when he won gold in the singles and silver in the doubles. Before this Games he was only able to win one medal in senior international competitions, a silver in the doubles together with Ewald Walch at the 1967 World Championships. In the following years he and his partner Walch were one of the best doubles team as they won gold at the World Championships in 1969 and 1970 and won silver in 1971. At the European Championships they won bronze in 1970 and silver in 1971. Schmid never won a singles title again, but won silver at the World Championships in 1969 and 1975 as well as bronze in 1978 and at the European Championships he won bronze in 1971 and silver in 1974. At the end of his career he also finished third in the inaugural Luge World Cup in 1977-78.


Schmid was a qualified machine fitter and, as was usual at that time, a true amateur, who had to take unpaid leave for his sport as he did during the 1968 Winter Olympics. In 1968 he became Styrian sportsmen of the year and was awarded the Ring of Honour of his hometown Liezen, who later also named a lane after him Manfred Schmid-Gasse. In 1996 he was awarded a Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Republic of Austria. His brother Rudolf was also a successful luger and won bronze in doubles at the 1976 Olympics.

But Walch had not always ridden with Schmid, as he had a long international career in doubles, starting with a bronze medal at the first official World Championships in 1957 at Davos, sliding with non-Olympian Erich Raffl. Walch would win seven doubles medals at the World Championships, with various partners, winning golds in 1960 (Reinhold Frosch), and 1969-70 (Schmid); silvers in 1967/1971 (Schmid); and bronzes in 1957 (Raffl) and 1963 (Anton Venier). He and Schmid were Austrian Champions in 1969-70 and 1972-73. Walch won three medals at the European Championships – a gold in 1962 with Frosch, and silver in 1971 and bronze in 1970 with Schmid.

Taught to sail at a young age by his father, Durward Knowles’ first major success in the Star Class on the international scene came in 1946, when he won a bronze medal alongside Basil Kelly at that year’s World Championships. The following year, with Sloane Farrington, he took gold and was selected for his first of eight Olympic teams. In 1948 he represented Great Britain and came in fourth with Farrington but, from 1952 on, Knowles represented the Bahamas. In 1952 he and Farrington were fifth, but they earned their first medal, bronze, in 1956, which became the nation’s first Olympic medal. Farrington remained with Knowles through 1960, when they placed sixth, and then retired in favor of Cecil Cooke. At the 1964 Games, Knowles and Cooke won Bahamas’ first Olympic gold medal, its last medal of any color until 1992, and its last Olympic title until 2000.


Knowles competed with his stepbrother Percy in 1968 and Montague Higgs in 1972, placing fifth and thirteenth respectively. When he made a surprise return at the 1988 Games, with Steven Kelly, he became one of only four Olympians at the time to have competed in eight editions of the Games (the others were Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm - for whom Seoul was also his eighth Olympics - and Italian equestrians Piero and Raimondo D'Inzeo). He also one of only four Olympians at that time to have competed over a span of 40 years (the others were Elvstrøm - who also accomplished this feat in Seoul - Norwegian sailor Magnus Konow, and Danish fencer Ivan Osiier). Knowles was the oldest competitor at the Games, carried the Bahamian flag in the Opening Ceremony, and finished 19th with a partner who had not even been born when Knowles had taken part in his first two Olympics.


In addition to his Olympic accomplishments, Knowles also took silver at the 1954 World Championships, with Farrington, gold at the 1959 Pan-American Games, again with Farrington, and bronze at the 1974 Worlds, with non-Olympian Gerald Ford. Knowles received the Olympic Order in Silver in 1989 and was knighted in 1996 for his accomplishments. Upon the death of Sándor Tarics in May 2016, Knowles became the oldest living Olympic champion.

At the 1964 Olympics, Angelo Damiano paired up with reigning Olympic tandem champion Sergio Bianchetto. They were lucky to proceed through the semi-finals, benefiting from the disqualification of their German opponents. The final was a close affair, beating the Soviets 2-1 after losing the first sprint. Damiano was also a decent individual sprinter, winning the Italian amateur title in 1964. His pro career, started in 1965, was fairly unremarkable, except for the bronze medal he won at the 1967 World Track Championships  in the sprint.

Sergio Bianchetto is the only cyclist to have won the Olympic tandem competition twice, taking the gold in 1960 and 1964. In Rome, he raced together with Giuseppe Beghetto, beating their German opponents clearly in two heats. Four years later, with Angelo Damiano, he survived a close semi-final against Germany, which was disqualified in the deciding heat of the semi-finals. In Tokyo, he also participated in the individual sprint event, finishing second behind his compatriot Giovanni Pettenella. Earlier, he had won four World Championship medals in the sprint, taking the gold in 1961 and 1962, and recorded a World Record over 200 m (flying start).

Willi Fuggerer was the top German amateur sprinter at the start of 1960s. Hailing from Nürnberg, Fuggerer was selected to the German national team in 1960 after he had won almost every local competition he entered at the end of 1950s. The high point of Fuggerer’s career was probably at the 1964 Olympics, where in the tandem semifinals he and Klaus Kobusch apparently won 2-1 against the Italian team, but were disqualified in the third race for moving out of their lane in the sprint. Fuggerer and Kobusch protested without success and won bronze after beating the Dutch team in the third-place race. Fuggerer also was fifth in the sprint at the 1964 Olympics.


Nationally Fuggerer won nine German titles between 1961-65 – sprint in 1964 and 1965, kilometre time trial in 1961, and tandem in 1961-63 (with Gerd Modrow) and 1964-65 (with Kobusch). He also won two sprint silvers (1961, 1962) and one kilometre time trial bronze (1962) at the German Championships. Fuggerer never turned professional and retired from sports after 1965 season, after which he worked as a long time cycling coach with his club RC Herpersdorf.

But most of her successes came in the pairs and fours events, partnered by Gloria Perrier. With Perrier she won the U.S. title in the K-2 from 1963 until 1965 and paddled with her in a K-4 boat to win the 1965 title in that discipline. At the 1964 Olympics, Francine Fox and Gloria Perrier paddled to a silver medal, trailing a German pair by two seconds. The pairing was interesting for the disparity in ages, as, in 1964, Fox was a 15-year-old high school student, while Perrier was 20 years older.

They rebounded in 1962, however, capturing the Canadian senior title and improving their placing to 4th at the World Championships.

In 1964 they took another Canadian title and won bronze medals at the World Championships and the Winter Olympic Games. Before the year was at its end, Wilkes had retired at the age of only 17. Her figure skating saga, however, had only just begun as a few weeks later it was discovered that the silver medal winners from Germany, Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler, had signed professional contracts before the Olympics and had therefore not been eligible to participate. Wilkes and Revell were then awarded silver, but Kilius and Bäumler were never officially removed as silver medalists by the ISU and, in 1987, had their medals returned by the German National Olympic Committee. In total, therefore, four silver medals were awarded for the event.


Outside of the controversy, Wilkes has spent her working life involved with figure skating as a broadcaster for CTV, an author and a coach. She obtained an undergraduate degree in psychology from York University, followed by a graduate one in communications from the University of Michigan in the 1970s. She led the CTV team that uncovered rigged judging at the 1999 World Championships. Since 2006, she has served as the director of sponsorship and marketing for Skate Canada.

Walter Außerdorfer started as a promising alpine skier, winning his first senior race at the age of 15, but his uncle persuaded him to switch to luge. His first appearance at the World Championships was 1959, with his best results at Worlds coming in his last appearance at that event in 1965, with ninth places in singles and doubles. He participated with the Italian national team at the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Games in singles, where he finished 16th, but in doubles, which was his specialty, he had his greatest success winning the bronze medal with Sigisfredo Mair. Even though they were trailing the third-placed German team after the first run, they managed to win bronze with an excellent second run. Außerdorfer later ran the Hotel Krone in his native Tiers, where he also acted as local councilor.

Sigisfredo Mair was active since the late 1950s, competing in singles and doubles. In doubles he teamed up with Walter Außerdorfer, achieving his greatest success at the 1964 Winter Olympics by winning the bronze medal. Because Außerdorfer was already about to retire, his brother Ernesto Mair became his new partner, and they won a bronze medal at the 1967 World Championships. Sigisfredo Mair’s highest rank in singles was a fourth place at the 1967 European Championships, and he was Italian Champion several times. The brother pair took part in two more Olympic Games but with limited success, and Mair retired after his third Olympics. A trained mason, Mair started a building company together with his two brothers in 1963. In 1967 he married Aloisia Nöckler, a sister of the Italian skier and Olympian Bruno Nöckler, with whom he had four children, but he was killed in a car accident in 1977 at age 38. Together with his wife his younger brother and luge partner Ernesto took over the family business.

Tony Nash, a director of the family engineering firm, was one of the key figures in the technical developments behind the resurgence of British bobsledding in the 1960’s. He was also a brilliant driver, and with Robin Dixon as his brakeman, they won the Olympic title in 1964 and the world title in 1964 and 1965. Nash and Dixon were such as outstanding partnership that their names are seldom mentioned separately and 25 years later no British pair has come close to matching their achievements. Both were awarded the MBE to mark their Olympic victory.

As Britain does not have a single bobsleigh run, the victory of Robin Dixon and Tony Nash in the two-man bobsleigh in 1964 has been compared with a competitor from a country without a pool winning a gold medal for swimming. Dixon and Nash had been well advised in their preparation by Formula 1 driver Tony Brooks and in 1963 they finished third in the World Championship that was held over the Olympic course at Igls, near Innsbruck, Austria. At the 1964 Olympics, the British pair was lying second to the Canadians after the opening run but moved into first position on the second run. They then lost the lead to the Italians before a magnificent fourth and final run gave them victory by the margin of 12/100ths of a second. The 1964 World Championship went with the Olympic title and with Nash as driver and Dixon as brakeman they retrained their world title at St Moritz in 1965. Although they failed to retain their Olympic title in 1968, they finished a commendable fifth at Alpe d’ Huez, France. 


He was one of the British Army's top sprinters when introduced to the sport by a friend, the later notorious Lord Lucan, while on holiday in St.Moritz in 1957.


Dixon was educated at Eton and was awarded the MBE in recognition of his Olympic success. He left the army in 1966 and pursued a successful business career with Kodak and the Redland building material company until the death of his father in 1995 meant he inherited the title of Baron Glentoran and a place in the House of Lords.Dixon became an active conservative member of the House and was one of the 96 hereditary peers to retain his place after the chamber was reformed in 1999. He served as Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland, Shadow Minister for Sport and Shadow Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs during the Conservative Party's time in opposition.

Zardini piloted the Italian 4-man team that won the 1963 World Championship, and won six silver medals and three bronze medals at the Worlds from 1958-1963. After the 1964 Winter Olympics, Zardini emigrated to Saint Sauveur, Québec, Canada, buying the Avila Ski Center there, and competed there for several years as a Canadian. In 1966 Zardini and Peter Kirby won the North American 2-man title for Canada. A few weeks later, at the Diamond Trophy Four-Man Championships, Zardini was driving a sled on the Mt. Hoevenberg run at Lake Placid, when he lost control on the Zig-Zag turn. His sled flew up the track into the retaining wall of Zag, crushing Zardini’s head against the wall, and killing him instantly.

Career switchEugenio Monti started out as a promising skier, nicknamed the Flying Redhead, before a knee injury in 1951 cut his career short. But the end of one career marked the start of another as Monti turned his attention to bobsleigh, with great success.


Olympic medals


At the 1956 Cortina Winter Games, Eugenio Monti earned silver medals in both the two-man and the four-man bobsleigh events. In 1960, the bobsled event was omitted from the Olympic programme. But the event returned four years later in Innsbruck and Monti won two bronze medals. By 1968, Monti had won nine World Championships and four Olympic medals, but no Olympic golds.


True sportsman


At the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Games, Monti also showed great sportsmanship. He helped his rivals Tony Nash and Robin Dixon win gold medals when he loaned them an axle bolt to replace one that had broken. The International Fair Play Committee rewarded Monti’s sportsmanship with the highest possible honour, the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Trophy.


Golden finale


Aged 40, Monti knew that the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games would be his last chance to win an Olympic title. Fired up, he claimed gold medals in both the two-man and four-man events. It was a memorable way for him to cap a colourful Olympic career.

Siorpaes then switched to Monti's team. In 1960 he and Monti won the World Championships in the four-man in his home town of Cortina d'Ampezzo. These World Championships were a substitute for the bob competitions that were not on the 1960 Winter Olympic program in Squaw Valley. At the next year’s World Championships Monti and Siorpaes won both the two- and four-man bob. The team did not compete at the 1962 World Championships but came back to take the title in the two-man again in 1963. After winning two bronze medals at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck they had their last great international achievement together winning the 1966 World Championship in the two-man, again in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Siorpaes’ fifth and last world title.

Competing at every edition of the Games from London 1948 through to Rome 1960, Sweden’s Gert Fredriksson won more Olympic medals than any other male kayaker in history.


A record margin in London


On 11 August 1948, the crowds who had gathered to watch the K-1 10,000m final on the banks of the River Thames at Henley saw history being made. Unusually for a kayak event, the final was a race “against the clock”, with each competitor making a staggered start in intervals of 30 seconds. Sweden’s Gert Fredriksson rose to the challenge superbly to record a time of 50.47:7 and leave second-placed Kurt Wires of Finland, trailing in his wake by a margin of 30.5 seconds. To this day, it remains the biggest winning margin in the history of the event. The final of the K-1 1,000m the following day reverted to a conventional group start but the outcome was the same, as the Swede was once more in unbeatable form. Holding back in fourth place for much of the race, he then accelerated into finish, crossing the line more than six seconds ahead of Norway’s Johan Frederik Kobberup. Fredriksson’s exploits at London 1948 were to be just the start of the Olympic journey for the 29-year old Nyköping-born paddler, whose impressive technique allied to enormous physical and mental strength, would provide him with the formula for success for over a decade.


Olympic treble over 1,000m


At Helsinki 1952, Fredriksson defended his K-1 1,000m title with another fine display of power kayaking, but had to settle for silver in the K-1 10,000m, finishing behind Finland’s Thorvald Strömberg. Four years later, on Lake Wendouree outside Melbourne, he reprised his achievements of London 1948, as he notched a third consecutive Olympic title in the K-1 1,000m and exacted his revenge on Strömberg over the longer distance, to secure a second golden double.


Last triumph in Rome


Fredriksson was back on the start line on Lake Albano, the hub for the rowing, canoe and kayak events at Rome 1960. Despite the fact that he was now 41, he took bronze in the K-1 1,000m and then secured another gold together with Sven-Olov Sjödelius in the K-2 1,000m. With eight medals, including six gold, he remains the most successful male kayaker in Olympic history.


Immortalised on home soil


Fredriksson finally retired from competition in 1964, having amassed seven world titles to go with his Olympic medal haul. However, he soon returned to the Olympic stage as trainer of the Swedish kayak team at the 1968 games in Mexico City. Nyköping honoured Fredriksson with a statue, ensuring that the incredible feats of its favourite son, who passed away in his home town on 5 July 2006, are immortalised in bronze.

Hans Fogh is one of only ten people, as of 2012, to have competed in sailing at six or more editions of the Olympic Games. Originally expected to work in gardening, like the rest of his family, he took up sailing at the age of 17 and quickly found success in the Flying Dutchman class, winning gold at the 1960 European Championships with Ole Gunnar Petersen. They were selected to represent Denmark at that year’s Summer Olympics, at which they clinched the silver medal by the end of the fifth race. Over the next 16 years he had numerous successes in the Flying Dutchman class: gold at the 1962 and 1973 World Championships (with Paul Elvstrøm and Evert Bastet respectively) and the 1976 European Championships Bastet, silver at the 1964 European Championships (with Petersen), and bronze at the 1974 World Championships (with Bastet). He also placed fourth, sixteenth, and seventh at the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Olympic Games respectively.


In 1969 Fogh moved to Toronto, Canada to open a sail-making business and earned his citizenship in 1975, paving the way for him to compete for that country at the 1976 Summer Olympics, where he finished fourth with Bastet. In 1974 he had begun to dabble in the Soling Class, winning the event at that year’s World Championships alongside Elvstrøm and the non-Olympian Bruce McCurrach. In total he won three European Championships in this class (1978, 1982, and 1983), one World Championship (2006), was runner-up in four North American Championships (1998, 2005, 2007, and 2008) and the 1987 Pan American Games, and came in third at the 1987 European Championships. He also competed at one more edition of the Olympic Games, winning bronze alongside Steve Calder and John Kerr in 1984. He is a member of Canada’s and the Etobicoke Sports Halls of Fame.

Murray Riley partnered Merv Wood to a bronze medal in the 1956 double sculls, after the pair had won gold medals in the doubles at the 1950 and 1954 Commonwealth Games. At the time the two were both police officers, but their careers would take decidedly different courses. Wood eventually became New South Wales (NSW) Police Commissioner in 1976, but stepped down in 1979, partly because of his association with Riley who had by then turned to a life of crime.


Riley joined the NSW police force in 1943, when only 17 years old, and he eventually rose to detective-sergeant, 3rd class. Major drug investigations in the 1960s found that Riley was associated with managers of several illegal gambling casinos in Sydney and Wollongong and it led to his involvement in drugs. In 1966 he was jailed for a year in New Zealand on charges of attempting to bribe a police inspector, after he was found to be involved in drug importation and cashing stolen American Express checks. After his release he linked up with well-known Australian crime figure Wally Dean and the two became supervisors for the Sydney League Clubs, and began scamming the clubs, extorting their services at very high fees in return for protection.


Riley disappeared for a few years but emerged in September 1974, helping Dean in an unsuccessful attempt to get elected to the South Sydney City Council. In October 1984, Riley came into the employ of Lennie McPherson, noted drug dealer, looking after collections from various gambling clubs and bookmakers, and providing protection for them.


Riley was also involved in the Nugan Hand Bank Scandal, which was a complex arrangement fronted by the United States CIA, and former US Green Beret Michael Hand, as a front to help catch drug dealers and exporters. It was found that in April 1976, Nugan Hand made cash transfers to Riley in Hong Kong, totaling about $1.2 million.  Riley used the cash to take delivery of heroin shipments. The Australian Joint Task Force on Drugs, concluded, ""Throughout 1976 Hand was knowingly involved in drug activity with the 'Riley' group in that he permitted and even encouraged the use of Nugan Hand facilities for the movement of drug money.""


Riley was finally caught in June 1978, when he was arrested after 4.3 tons of cannabis was found onboard the yacht Anoa at Polkington Reef, east of Papua New Guinea. Riley pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Judge Kenneth Torrington to 5-10 years in jail.  The sentence was extended 7 years when he was found to have defrauded American Express of $274,000. Riley was released in May 1984, having served only 6 of 17 years. He soon became involved with drugs again, attempts to smuggle over 50 kg of heroin from Papua New Guinea to distribute in Australia.


By the early 1990s Riley had changed his name to Murray Lee Stewart by deed poll. In October 1990 Riley and Jonathan Nicholas Gould were arrested in Great Britain for conspiring to defraud British Aerospace PLC of £40,000,000 via computer fraud. They were convicted in July 1991 and sentenced to five years in prison. Riley had many friends and he was sent to an open prison farm at Spring Hill Prison in Aylesbury, which he simply walked out of in December 1991. He remained at large for eight weeks, traveling in Northern Ireland, Spain and Belgium before being recaptured in January 1992. He was moved to a minimum security prison in Kent, and escaped from there, with IRA help, in January 1993, settling in Hong Kong, where he lived incognito, before returning to Queensland, Australia in early 1994.


In January 2008, historian Dr. John Jiggens of the Queensland University of Technology, deepened the crime connection of Riley with the publication of his book The Sydney Connection: Nugan Hand, Murray Riley, and the Murder of Donald Mackay. Mackay was a furniture store owner in the NSW town of Griffith, who in 1975, tipped off police about a large marijuana plantation at Coleambally, south of Griffith. Mackay was murdered outside the Hotel Griffith on 15 July 1977, as his bloodstained car and spent .22 cartridges were found in the hotel carpark the next day, although his body was never recovered. Jiggens notes in the book that Nugan and Riley were key figures in an international drug-smuggling group supplying the United States market in the 1970s.

Mervyn Wood began his rowing career as a sweep oarsman, rowing in seat five in the 1936 Olympics with the New South Wales eight which dominated Australian rowing for years.  He would certainly have competed in the Olympics in both 1940 and 1944 but for the war.  Still he competed in the Olympics through 1956, one of the longest careers ever.  In 1948, Wood, by then a sculler, won the great double of the Olympic single sculls championship and the Diamond Sculls at Henley.  In 1952, Wood lost the Olympic sculls title to Yury Tyukalov, but he again won the Diamond Sculls.  Although Wood still attempted to row singles, he was unable to overcome Australia's new great, Stuart MacKenzie, and the remainder of his international appearances were in doubles.  In 1956, Wood and Murray Riley won a bronze medal at the Olympics in the doubles, and in 1958, Wood paired with MacKenzie to win a silver medal at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games. In the 1950 British Empire Games he won the gold medal in the single sculls and in the double sculls (with Riley). Four years later in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Wood won the gold medal in the double sculls (again with Riley) and in the coxed fours and in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Wood won silver in the double sculls (with MacKenzie). Wood was a police officer as a career, and in 1977 became Commissioner of the New South Wales police force (1976-79). Wood's 1956 doubles partner, Riley, was also a policeman, but after he left the force he became an international drug smuggler. The controversy this caused led Wood to stepdown as Commissioner in 1979.

The first time New Zealand sent yachtsmen to an Olympic Games they won a gold medal. Peter Mander and Jack Cropp competed in the 12-metre Sharpie class in Melbourne in 1956 in Jest, a boat built by Mander. The New Zealanders won three of the seven races and their closest rivals, the Australians, won two, giving Mander and Cropp the gold medal on a countback. They thought they'd won the silver when they were second in the final race, but the Australian skipper, Rolly Tasker, had been disqualified and the two rival countries ended with an equal number of points. It was the greater number of wins for Mander and Cropp that made the difference. It was fitting that Mander skippered the winning boat because he had been instrumental in forming the New Zealand Yachting Federation, a pre-requisite to being accepted in the Olympics.

A sailor since the age of six, Australian Rolly Tasker gained an interest in the sport when his parents introduced him to model ships as a young boy. He built his first racing dinghy, including the sails, at the age of ten and began a journey that would encompass, throughout the course of his life, over 7000 competitive races. Following service in World War II, where he saw action at the infamous Battle of Ambon, he founded a sail-making business and began exporting his products in 1949. His fame in the sporting realm grew rapidly as he captured Australian national titles in the 12 Square meter Sharpie class every year from 1952 through 1956, the year in which he also won an Olympic silver medal alongside John Scott in the Two Person Heavyweight Dinghy, Mixed event at the Melbourne Summer Games. 


In 1957 it was announced that the Flying Dutchman class would replace the 12 Square meter Sharpie event at the 1960 Summer Olympics and Tasker wasted no time earning his reputation in these vessels as well, winning the Australian National Championships in 1957, 1958, 1960, and 1962 as well as the World Championship in 1958. At the 1960 Summer Games, however, he finished 18th out of 31 teams. After becoming the World B Class Catamaran champion in 1966 he switched to ocean racing and, from 1969 through 1985, rose to unprecedented fame in the Western Australian ocean racing scene through his countless victories and the numerous records he shattered while achieving them. Among his most notable appearances was the 1978 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race where, after being disqualified on a technicality, he sailed the race anyways with a five minute head start and completed the course 20 hours ahead of the official winner. He was also a participant in the notorious 1979 Fastnet race, where fifteen people died during disastrous weather and only 86 of the 303 starters finished.


Nearing 70 and now a member of the Western Australian Hall of Champions, having been inducted in 1986, Tasker was far from finished with his career. In 1994 he moved to Thailand and set up a new sail-making factory in Phuket, quickly turning it into a multi-million dollar business. He was made a member of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Order of Australia in 2006; in 2008 he opened the Australian Sailing Museum, the same year his biography “Sailing to the Moon” came out, the title referencing the fact that he had sailed farther than the distance of the moon over the course of his career. Having suffered from skin cancer since the age of 40, the result of decades spent under the sun at sea, he battled the disease for over half his life until he died of its effects in June 2012 at the age of 86.

Jasper Blackall was not particularly prominent on the international sailing scene during the 1950s but, prior to the 1956 Summer Olympics, he teamed up with Terence Smith and was chosen to represent Great Britain in the Sharpie Class at the Games. Riding in a German-built boat from 1931, the duo performed fairly consistently throughout the tournament and ended up with a bronze medal, well behind the New Zealand and Australian teams, but comfortably ahead of the Italians. Neither sailor appeared in the Olympics again, but Blackall continued to compete on and off internationally, and eventually moved to Portugal. A member of the Burnham Sailing Club, by career he was an illustrator and designer.

Taught to sail at a young age by his father, Durward Knowles’ first major success in the Star Class on the international scene came in 1946, when he won a bronze medal alongside Basil Kelly at that year’s World Championships. The following year, with Sloane Farrington, he took gold and was selected for his first of eight Olympic teams. In 1948 he represented Great Britain and came in fourth with Farrington but, from 1952 on, Knowles represented the Bahamas. In 1952 he and Farrington were fifth, but they earned their first medal, bronze, in 1956, which became the nation’s first Olympic medal. Farrington remained with Knowles through 1960, when they placed sixth, and then retired in favor of Cecil Cooke. At the 1964 Games, Knowles and Cooke won Bahamas’ first Olympic gold medal, its last medal of any color until 1992, and its last Olympic title until 2000.


Knowles competed with his stepbrother Percy in 1968 and Montague Higgs in 1972, placing fifth and thirteenth respectively. When he made a surprise return at the 1988 Games, with Steven Kelly, he became one of only four Olympians at the time to have competed in eight editions of the Games (the others were Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm - for whom Seoul was also his eighth Olympics - and Italian equestrians Piero and Raimondo D'Inzeo). He also one of only four Olympians at that time to have competed over a span of 40 years (the others were Elvstrøm - who also accomplished this feat in Seoul - Norwegian sailor Magnus Konow, and Danish fencer Ivan Osiier). Knowles was the oldest competitor at the Games, carried the Bahamian flag in the Opening Ceremony, and finished 19th with a partner who had not even been born when Knowles had taken part in his first two Olympics.


In addition to his Olympic accomplishments, Knowles also took silver at the 1954 World Championships, with Farrington, gold at the 1959 Pan-American Games, again with Farrington, and bronze at the 1974 Worlds, with non-Olympian Gerald Ford. Knowles received the Olympic Order in Silver in 1989 and was knighted in 1996 for his accomplishments. Upon the death of Sándor Tarics in May 2016, Knowles became the oldest living Olympic champion.

As an amateur, Pinarello won two Olympic tandem bronzes – in 1952 with Antonio Maspes and 1956 with Giuseppe Ogna, sprint silver at the 1953 World Championships and sprint bronze at the 1955 Worlds. He was also twice Italian sprint champion (1953, 1955), and in 1953 was six-day champion in Milano and won the amateur København Grand Prix.

Career switchEugenio Monti started out as a promising skier, nicknamed the Flying Redhead, before a knee injury in 1951 cut his career short. But the end of one career marked the start of another as Monti turned his attention to bobsleigh, with great success.


Olympic medals


At the 1956 Cortina Winter Games, Eugenio Monti earned silver medals in both the two-man and the four-man bobsleigh events. In 1960, the bobsled event was omitted from the Olympic programme. But the event returned four years later in Innsbruck and Monti won two bronze medals. By 1968, Monti had won nine World Championships and four Olympic medals, but no Olympic golds.

At the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Games, Monti also showed great sportsmanship. He helped his rivals Tony Nash and Robin Dixon win gold medals when he loaned them an axle bolt to replace one that had broken. The International Fair Play Committee rewarded Monti’s sportsmanship with the highest possible honour, the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Trophy.

Aged 40, Monti knew that the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games would be his last chance to win an Olympic title. Fired up, he claimed gold medals in both the two-man and four-man events. It was a memorable way for him to cap a colourful Olympic career.

Renzo Alverà was the brakeman for the legendary Eugenio Monti, one of many talents that were formed on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d’Ampezzo in the postwar period. He started racing in 1953 and only three years later won two silver medals on his )home) track at the 1956 Winter Olympics. He missed an additional Olympic appearance since no bobsleigh events were held at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. In 1957 he won the first gold medal at the St. Moritz World Championships in the two-man bobsleigh, and the team of Monti/Alverà won four consecutive World Championships through 1960. In the four-man bobsleigh he won another two gold medals at World Championships in 1960 and 1961 and another silver medal in 1957. At home Alverà was a three-time Italian Champion in two-man bobsleigh from 1958-60, while in the four-man bob he won another three Italian Championships and another third place between 1954-60. He retired from racing after winning the 1961 World Championships. His older brother Michael Alverà was also a successful bobsledder and a 1952 Olympian. Renzo Alverà worked as a gardener in his later life. He died after a long illness after a stroke confined him to a wheelchair. In 2011, a part of the Cortina track was named for him.

Over the course of his ten year bobsledding career, Max Angst was a five-time Swiss champion and a bronze medalist in the four-man event at the 1960 World Championships, alongside Hans-Jörg Hirschbühl, Göpf Kottmann, and the non-Olympian René Kuhl  (this was a special event, as bobsledding was absent from that year’s Winter Olympics). His greatest success, however, came at the 1956 Winter Olympics, where he took bronze in the two-man event with Harry Warburton. Outside of sports Angst was a butcher and, with his brother Heiri (who won Olympic gold in the four-man), ran a meat business that spread throughout Switzerland and overseas as far as Brazil.

In the mid-1950s, Harry Warburton was one of Switzerland’s top bobsledders. He got his first major taste of success at the 1954 World Championships, where he won the four-man event alongside Heiri Angst, Gottfried Diener, and Fritz Feierabend. Feierabend and Warburton were on a different Swiss crew at the 1955 edition, with Aby Gartmann and Rolf Gerber, and finished in second place behind their compatriots. They managed to best Angst and Franz Kapus in the two-man event, however, and claim gold. At the 1956 Winter Olympics Warburton teamed up with Heiri’s brother, Max, and took bronze in the two-man, while also coming in fourth in the four-man. He retired from active competition shortly after the Games.

One of the all-time greatest track sprinters, Antonio Maspes won seven professional World Championships between 1955-64, tying the record, held at the time by Jef Scherens – it has since been surpassed by Koichi Nakano, with 10. Having won an Olympic bronze in the tandem sprint in 1952, Maspes won his first world title in 1955, the other six following in 1956, 1959-1962 and 1964, while medalling also in 1958 and 1963. Maspes was well-known for his long sur places – in 1960 he even broke the 200 m world record after a 25-minute standstill. Maspes also collected a record five consecutive wins in the Grand Prix de Paris (1960-64). After his death in 2000, the famous Velodromo Vigorelli in Milano, where Maspes had started racing, was renamed in his honor.

A second cousin to Giovanni “Nane” Pinarello, who founded the famous Pinarello bicycle shop in Treviso, which has supplied cycles to such stars as Miguel Indurain, Jan Ullrich, Erik Zabel and Bradley Wiggins, to name a few, Cesare Pinarello was the top Italian amateur track sprinter at the start of the 1950s. As an amateur, Pinarello won two Olympic tandem bronzes – in 1952 with Antonio Maspes and 1956 with Giuseppe Ogna, sprint silver at the 1953 World Championships and sprint bronze at the 1955 Worlds. He was also twice Italian sprint champion (1953, 1955), and in 1953 was six-day champion in Milano and won the amateur København Grand Prix. Pinarello turned professional in 1957 and rode for such teams as Ignis, Philco, Termozeta Dei and GBC until his retirement in 1968. After his retirement, Pinarello ran a coffee shop in Treviso and also managed local amateur teams, most notably GS Zalf-Fior in the 1980s.

In 1952, Charlie Logg was a junior at Rutgers with only three years of rowing experience and had never sat in a pair-oared shell until three months before the Olympics. Worse yet, his Olympic crewmate, Tom Price, had never rowed until the Olympic year. So at the Olympics, Logg and Price predictably finished dead last in their first heat behind boats from Switzerland, Britain, and Belgium. But Logg and Price came through the repêchage and defeated those same three shells in the finals to win a gold medal, and earn the sobriquet, ""The Cinderella Kids"", in the process. Logg served in the U.S. Army for six years after the Olympics and, after winning a PanAm gold with Price in 1955, they made an abortive attempt to qualify together for the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. Through the 1960s he was involved in several companies in the helicopter industry but left that in 1971 to start his own farming operation in Florida.

At the time he was a freshman at Rutgers and his partner was also a Rutgers student, Charles Logg. Together they were soundly beaten in the first heat of the Olympics, finishing last. However they came through the repêchages to the final where they met the same three boats who had beaten them in the first round. In the finals they reversed the decision to take the gold medal, being dubbed the ""Cinderella Kids"" in the process. At the 1955 Pan American Games they also won coxless paris event.

Before World War II, Kurt Wires was a promising young kayaker, but his career was interrupted by the war. Wires served with the Finnish Army and lost his right eye during the Continuation War. Wires continued his sporting career after WWII and rose to be one of the top long-distance kayakers of the world. Wires first competed internationally at the 1948 Olympics, where he won a silver medal in K1-10,000, just half-a-minute behind the favorite Gert Fredriksson of Sweden.


Wires initially retired from sports after the 1948 Olympics, but made a comeback in 1952, when the Olympic Games were held in his hometown of Helsinki. At the Finnish Olympic trials he finished only third behind Thorvald Strömberg and Yrjö Hietanen and was not selected to the Finnish Olympic team in K1 events. Wires then teamed up with young and promising Hietanen to compete in K2 events at the Olympics, which they surprisingly won in front of the home crowd, beating the favorites Swedes Gunnar Åkerlund and Hans Wetterström by 0.4 seconds in the K2-10,000 event and a day later beating the favorites Swedes Lars Glassér and Ingemar Hedberg by mere centimeters in the K2-1000 event. After the Olympics, Wires retired from sports for good.


Outside of sports, Wires worked his whole life with the office equipment distributor Oy Konttorityö. Starting as a salesman in 1945, Wires was promoted to sales manager in 1954 and retired from the firm in 1987 as vice-president.

In 1953 he won the silver medal in both the two-man and the four-man event at his hometown track of  Garmisch-Partenkirchen.


Ostler also won two gold medals at the 1952 Winter Games at Oslo with Nieberl in the two-man event and completed by Fritz Kuhn and Franz Kemser in the four-man event. In order to have a shot at the title, the second German four-man sled wasn't entered, and instead the two heaviest pushers – Kuhn and Kemser – joined Ostler and Nieberl in the remaining sled. This gave the Germans a decisive advantage, as they weighed in at 472 kg (including sled), and they comfortably slid to the gold. The international bobsleigh federation (FIBT) soon afterwards decided to limit the weight for four-man teams to 420 kg. Four years later Ostler was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony at Cortina d'Ampezzo and placed eighth in the two-man event with Hans Hohenester. 


Ostler made his living as a restaurant proprietor. In 2006 the story about the 1952 German four-man bob was told in a cinema comedy called Schwere Jungs (Heavy Boys).

Nieberl also won two gold medals at the 1952 Winter Games at Oslo with Ostler in the two-man event and completed by Fritz Kuhn and Franz Kemser in the four-man event. In order to have a shot at the title, the second German four-man sled wasn't entered, and instead the two heaviest pushers – Kuhn and Kemser – joined Ostler and Nieberl in the remaining sled. This gave the Germans a decisive advantage, as they weighed in at 472 kg (including sled), and they comfortably slid to the gold. The international bobsleigh federation (FIBT) soon afterwards decided to limit the weight for four-man teams to 420 kg. Four years later Nieberl slid with Hans Rösch, placing ninth in the two-man event and sixth in the four-man event with his sled completed by Pössinger and Sylvester Wackerle.


Nieberl's wife, Evi Lanig, and his brother-in-law, Hans Peter Lanig, were alpine skiers. In 2006 the story about the 1952 German four-man bob was told in a cinema comedy called Schwere Jungs (Heavy Boys).

Stan Benham is probably the most titled man in American bobsledding, even though his best years came at the end of the USA's great success in the sport. In 1949 and 1950 he drove the 4-man sled that won the world title for the United States, the first two times this had been done. His other titles included the North American 2-man (1951, 1954, and 1956) and 4-man (1948, 1951, 1953, and 1956), and the AAU 2-man (1954, and 1956-57) and 4-man (1948, 1951, 1953-54 and 1956-57). He was renowned as a driver and drove with various partners, while representing the Lake Placid Bobsled Club. Benham lived in Lake Placid most of his life, where he was the manager of the extensive park district and chief of the volunteer fire department. In the 60s he also did some commentary for televised bobsled competition.

Fritz Feierabend was one of Switzerland’s greatest athletes to never win an Olympic gold medal. He joined the Swiss national bobsledding team in 1933 and had his first major international success at the 1935 World Championships, where he won a bronze medal  in the four-man alongside Reto Capadrutt and the non-Olympians A. Lardi and H. Tami. Feierabend and Capadrutt then travelled to the 1936 Winter Olympics where, with Hans Aichele and Hans Bütikofer, they captured a silver medal in the four-man. Feierabend and Joseph Beerli also took silver in the two-man event. This duo then earned bronze at the 1938 World Championships, while Feierabend had his first major international victory a year later, capturing gold in the four-man at the 1939 edition alongside Beerli and the non-Olympians Heinz Cattani and Alphonse Hörning.


Feierabend’s career was interrupted by World War II, but he returned in top form at the 1947 World Championships and won both the two- (with Stephan Waser ) and four-man (alongside Beerli, Cattani, and Hörning) events. His next stop was the 1948 Winter Olympics, where he took silver in the two-man with Paul Eberhard and finished fourth in the four-man alongside Heiri Angst, Felix Endrich, and Fritz Waller. The latter event would be the only Olympic one in which Feierabend would fail to medal over his career.


At the 1949 World Championships, Feierabend and Angst earned silver in the two-man and, with Waller and Werner Spring, bronze in the four-man. One year later Feierabend and Waser won the two-man and, alongside Albert Madörin and the non-Olympian Romi Spada, earned silver in the four-man. After coming up empty at the 1951 World Championships, Feierabend and Waser captured bronze in both the two- and four-man events at the 1952 Winter Olympics, aided in the latter by Madörin and André Filippini. Feierabend did not receive any medals at the 1953 World Championships, but then won the four-man the following year with Angst, Gottfried Diener, and Harry Warburton. His last major international championship was the 1955 World Championships, where he and Warburton took gold in the two-man and silver in the four-man alongside Aby Gartmann and Rolf Gerber. Feierabend retired from active competition with five Swiss national championships under his belt. By career he was involved in his father’s bobsled-building business and, together, they built the first all-steel bobsleigh.

Stephan Waser enjoyed a successful career on the international bobsledding scene in the years following World War II. Representing Switzerland, he first gained international attention at the 1947 World Championships by winning the two-man event with veteran Fritz Feierabend. He was not selected for the 1948 Winter Olympics, but teamed up with Feierabend at the 1950 World Championships and captured gold in the two-man and silver in the four-man, the latter with the assistance of Albert Madörin and the non-Olympian Romi Spada.  Waser and Feierabend then attended the 1952 Winter Olympics, where they earned bronze in the two and four-man events, the latter alongside Madörin and André Filippini. Waser retired from active competition shortly after the Games.

Karol Kennedy partnered her brother, Peter, in two Olympics. They finished sixth at St. Moritz in 1948 but improved to the silver medal at Oslo four years later. In 1950 they became the first Americans to win the World Pairs Championship. The sixth place finish at St. Moritz was perhaps Karol Kennedy’s most amazing feat. She was having severe back pains, radiating down a leg and causing some loss of control over the muscles in that leg. It required disc surgery later in the year and doctors wondered in amazement how she could have even walked, much less skated in the Olympics. Peter Kennedy once joked that his sister’s goal in life was to be married and have six children. She succeeded at that goal.

Peter Kennedy retired from competitive skating after the 1952 Olympics and took up skiing. He went to the Olympic trials at that sport in 1956 but just missed the team.

In 1952 he was again an alternate on the Olympic team. He scored his first victory in the Prince of Wales Cup in 1932, with his record 12th and last win coming 33 years later, and claimed countless other victories in major events, including wins in the European championships. He was also the British champion in both the Swallow and Firefly classes. Stewart Morris was a member of many yachting clubs, including the Royal Yacht Squadron. In 1944 he was awarded the OBE for his part in the Normandy landing while serving as a Commander in the RNVR.

With the experienced Stewart Morris as helmsman and David Bond as crew, Britain’s entry Swift won the Swallow class event on the only occasion it was included in the Olympic yachting program. Their partnership was formed only a few months before the Games began when Morris and his usual crewman parted company after a disagreement and ended with the end of the 1948 Games. As a crewman Bond's name was usually omitted from newspaper reports and many of his colleagues at BOAC were not aware of his success until he produced his medal on his return to work.


Bond himself was educated at Harrow and served as an aircraftsman in the RAF in the war, after which he worked for the British Aircraft Corporation. After an unsuccessful period as a market gardener he later became a successful yacht builder in Cornwall.Bond was the only British Olympic champion from the 1948 Games still alive when the Olympic Games returned to the British capital in 2012 and belatedly received some of the publicity of which he had been denied in 1948.

Initially he practiced admiralty law in New York for nine years, but then set up his own sailmaking business. The venture proved to be very successful and Torrey sold the business to Charles Ulmer, Inc., although he was retained by the owners as vice president and designer. Because there were no Swallow class boats in the U.S. in 1948, the American entry for the Olympics was the runner-up boat in the Star class at the U.S. Trials. Despite their obvious unfamiliarity with the boat, Torrey and his crew member, Woody Pirie, surprisingly took the bronze medals. Torrey continued to be active in sailing, both through his business and, in 1983, as a sail consultant to the America's Cup trial yacht, Courageous.

The family, including his brother Jan Maas, moved to the Netherlands in 1915, settling in Hilversum, but moved to the US for a few years afterwards. The Maas brothers both travelled to Los Angeles for the 1932 Olympics, with Bob unusually participating in two events. In his solo boat, the Snowbird (a 1-person dinghy), Maas seemed to have captured the gold medal, sailing out his last race carefully without fighting for a win. His French opponent Jacques Baptiste Lebrun, however, successfully contested an earlier penalty after the competition had ended, which moved him into first place, and relegated Maas to silver. The Maas brothers placed 6th in the Star, which was to become Bob Maas's boat of preference. At the 1936 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in that boat, sailing with Willem de Vries Lentsch. After the War, he returned to the Olympics twice more, earning his third medal, another bronze in the 1948 Star, now pairing Eddy Stutterheim. Maas only once participated in the Star World Championships, which were generally held in the US during his career. When they were held in Kiel, in 1939, he only ranked 18th.

Hans Kalt won the 1948 coxless pairs silver medal with his brother Josef and the 1952 bronze medal with Kurt Schmid. They started for the See-Club Zug and were coached by Kurt's father Karl Schmid. At the 1948 Olympics at Henley there were only three boats in the final. Hans and his brother Josef had won the preliminaries and the semi-final ahead of the Australians. In the final they were beaten by the British pair of Jack Wilson and Ran Laurie, whose son, Hugh Laurie, later became a movie and television star (Dr. House). At the 1950 European Championships Hans Kalt and Schmid won the European Championship, adding a bronze medal in 1951. At the 1952 Helsinki Olympics they again advanced to the final, losing to the Americans and Belgians, winning a bronze medal. Domestically Hans Kalt was the Swiss coxless pairs champion with his brother in 1943-1945 and 1947-1948, while being second in 1946 and with Schmid in 1950 and 1953, while being second in 1952. Hans Kalt also won single sculls silver at the 1949 Swiss championships.


In 1966 Kalt was among the founding members of the Curling Club Zug and became an Honorary Member in 2000. He was also one of the founding members of the Panathlon-Club Zug and later became Honorary President. He and his brother Josef worked in the family owned printing company Kalt-Bucher Druck AG in Zug. Hans later married Thea Mathilde Jans and changed his surname to Kalt-Jans.

Hans Berglund was already a successful kayaker prior to World War II, winning a silver medal (in the K2 1,000 m with the non-Olympian Kurt Boo) at the inaugural World Canoeing Championships in 1938. Ten years later, he paired up with Lennart Klingström to win the Olympic gold in that same category. With the two kayakers from the Swedish 10,000 m boat (Gunnar Åkerlund and Hans Wetterström, also champions), they also formed the winning quartet in the K4 1,000 m event. At the time, that event did not have Olympic status, but it did earn them a World Championship gold medal. Hans passed on his canoeing talent to his son, Bo Berglund, who also competed in the K2 1,000 m at the 1972 Olympics, although he did not make the final.

With partner Wallace Diestelmeyer, Suzanne ""Suzi"" Morrow not only won a bronze medal in figure skating pairs at the 1948 Winter Olympics, but developed and first performed figure skating's ""death spiral"" with only one hand. Previously this move, which entails the man pivoting with one toe on the ice while the woman circles him with her body almost parallel to the ice, had been performed professionally with two hands, and thus the female was not lowered entirely to the ice. The previous year she and Diestelmeyer had been the North American pairs champions and together they spent two years (1947-1948) as Canadian champions in the event, and had claimed a bronze medal at the World Championships in the pairs event earlier that year. Morrow also had a successful career in the singles category and was Canadian champion for three consecutive years from 1949 through 1951. At the World Championships, however, she went from 13th (1948) to 4th (1950-1952), then back down to 5th (1953). She competed in this event twice at the Winter Olympics, placing 14th in 1948 and 6th in 1952. After her retirement, she worked as a figure skating judge for more than fifty years, including at World Championship and Olympic events. At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, she became the first woman to take the Olympic judge's oath. She obtained a degree in veterinary medicine in 1952 and worked as a veterinarian until 1995, as well as a dog show judge with the Canadian Kennel Club. She, along with partner Diestelmeyer, was made a member of the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 1992.

Felix Endrich first made his mark on the international bobsledding scene in 1947, when he earned a silver medal in the two-man event at the World Championships with Fritz Waller. The duo then travelled to the 1948 Winter Olympics, where they won the two-man event and, alongside Heiri Angst and Fritz Feierabend, came in fourth in the four-man competition. Endrich was also Switzerland’s flagbearer during the opening ceremonies of these Games. Endrich and Waller became world champions in 1949 and, after Waller retired from active competition, Endrich teamed up with Werner Spring and took bronze in the two-man at the 1951 World Championships. This new duo attended the 1952 Winter Olympics, but came in fourth in both the two- and four-man events, assisted by Franz Kapus and Fritz Stöckli in the latter. With Stöckli’s help, Endrich redeemed himself at the 1953 World Championships by winning the two-man title, but his triumph was to be short lived. While engaging in a trial run for the four-man event, Endrich skidded over a wall on a dangerous curve and was thrown into a tree. Suffering a broken neck and a shattered skull, he was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital, at the age of 32. An office equipment salesman by career, he had been married less than a month prior to his death. Stöckli escaped the accident with only minor injuries, while the other two members of the team, Aby Gartmann and the non-Olympian Rene Heiland, suffered serious injuries, but recovered. Two years earlier, Swedish bobsledder Rudolf Odenrich had died at the same curve.

Fritz Feierabend was one of Switzerland’s greatest athletes to never win an Olympic gold medal. He joined the Swiss national bobsledding team in 1933 and had his first major international success at the 1935 World Championships, where he won a bronze medal  in the four-man alongside Reto Capadrutt and the non-Olympians A. Lardi and H. Tami. Feierabend and Capadrutt then travelled to the 1936 Winter Olympics where, with Hans Aichele and Hans Bütikofer, they captured a silver medal in the four-man. Feierabend and Joseph Beerli also took silver in the two-man event. This duo then earned bronze at the 1938 World Championships, while Feierabend had his first major international victory a year later, capturing gold in the four-man at the 1939 edition alongside Beerli and the non-Olympians Heinz Cattani and Alphonse Hörning.


Feierabend’s career was interrupted by World War II, but he returned in top form at the 1947 World Championships and won both the two- (with Stephan Waser ) and four-man (alongside Beerli, Cattani, and Hörning) events. His next stop was the 1948 Winter Olympics, where he took silver in the two-man with Paul Eberhard and finished fourth in the four-man alongside Heiri Angst, Felix Endrich, and Fritz Waller. The latter event would be the only Olympic one in which Feierabend would fail to medal over his career.


At the 1949 World Championships, Feierabend and Angst earned silver in the two-man and, with Waller and Werner Spring, bronze in the four-man. One year later Feierabend and Waser won the two-man and, alongside Albert Madörin and the non-Olympian Romi Spada, earned silver in the four-man. After coming up empty at the 1951 World Championships, Feierabend and Waser captured bronze in both the two- and four-man events at the 1952 Winter Olympics, aided in the latter by Madörin and André Filippini. Feierabend did not receive any medals at the 1953 World Championships, but then won the four-man the following year with Angst, Gottfried Diener, and Harry Warburton. His last major international championship was the 1955 World Championships, where he and Warburton took gold in the two-man and silver in the four-man alongside Aby Gartmann and Rolf Gerber. Feierabend retired from active competition with five Swiss national championships under his belt. By career he was involved in his father’s bobsled-building business and, together, they built the first all-steel bobsleigh.

Pierre Georget came from a cycling family, as his father, Léon, and uncle, Émile, were both top racers. Pierre Georget's top international placements were second at the World Sprint Championships in both 1936 and 1937. He lost the 1936 title to Arie van Vliet, who also nipped him for the 1936 kilometre time trial gold medal at Berlin.


His father, Léon, was best known for winning the Bol d'Or nine times – in 1903, 1907-13, and 1919. He was a well-known six-day racer, winning a six-day in Toulouse in 1906 with his brother, Émile. Émile Georget rode a number of six-days, but had more varied palmares than his brother. He won Bordeaux-Paris in 1910 and 1912, the 1910 French National Championship, and Paris-Brest-Paris in 1911. Émile also placed third in the Tour de France in 1907 and 1911.

Bob Maas was born in the Dutch East Indies, where his father ran a medicine importing business. The family, including his brother Jan Maas, moved to the Netherlands in 1915, settling in Hilversum, but moved to the US for a few years afterwards. The Maas brothers both travelled to Los Angeles for the 1932 Olympics, with Bob unusually participating in two events. In his solo boat, the Snowbird (a 1-person dinghy), Maas seemed to have captured the gold medal, sailing out his last race carefully without fighting for a win. His French opponent Jacques Baptiste Lebrun, however, successfully contested an earlier penalty after the competition had ended, which moved him into first place, and relegated Maas to silver. The Maas brothers placed 6th in the Star, which was to become Bob Maas's boat of preference. At the 1936 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in that boat, sailing with Willem de Vries Lentsch. After the War, he returned to the Olympics twice more, earning his third medal, another bronze in the 1948 Star, now pairing Eddy Stutterheim. Maas only once participated in the Star World Championships, which were generally held in the US during his career. When they were held in Kiel, in 1939, he only ranked 18th. Maas, who imported US cars and sold them in Utrecht, continued to sail competitively into the 1960s, although with diminishing successes. In 2009, the Dutch Sailing Federation first staged the annual Bob Maas Trofee, a Star competition.

Generally considered to be one of the two finest British oarsmen ever (with Stephen Redgrave), Jack Beresford was born into a rowing family with his father, Julius Beresford, having won an Olympic silver medal in the coxed fours, outriggers in 1912. Jack first showed his inherent talent at Bedford School where he stroked the eight and also captained in the rugby football XV. After serving in the Liverpool Scottish Regiment, his Olympic career began in 1920 when he placed second to the American, Jack Kelly, Sr., in the single sculls. At the Paris Olympics four years later, Beresford met another fine American sculler, Garrett Gilmore, and after losing to Gilmore in the heats Beresford reached the final via the repêchage which had been introduced into Olympic competition that year. In the final, Beresford gained revenge for his earlier defeat in the heats by defeating Gilmore quite comfortably to win the first of his three Olympic gold medals. At the 1928 Olympics, Beresford demonstrated his versatility by winning a silver medal in the eights. In the 1930 British Empire Games he represented England and won the silver medal in the single sculls competition. He then won a gold in the coxless fours in 1932, won his third Olympic gold medal in the double sculls in 1936 and was in training for a sixth Olympic appearance when war intervened in 1940. Until Redgrave duplicated the feat, no other British oarsman came close to matching his record of competing in five Olympics and winning a medal in each. Away from the Olympics his record was no less impressive; he won the Wingfield Sculls seven consecutive years (1920-26), the Diamond Sculls four times and the Grand, the Stewards’ and the Silver Goblets twice each. Beresford, who rowed for the Thames, Kingston and Leander clubs, was awarded the Olympic Diploma of merit in 1949. He later managed the British rowing team at the 1952 Olympics, and in 1960, Jack Beresford was awarded a CBE for his services to rowing and that same year his nephew Michael Beresford took part in the coxless fours at the Rome Olympics. This meant that the  Beresford's became the first British family to have three generations represent them at the Olympic Games.

On leaving Latymer Upper School, Dick Southwood initially joined the Auriol Rowing Club where his sculling potential was spotted by Jack Beresford, Jr.. He then joined Beresford at the London Rowing Club and made his Olympic début in 1932 when he reached the final of the single sculls only to finish in last place following an attack of cramp in his left shoulder. Four years later in Berlin, Southwood partnered Jack Beresford in the double sculls and they scored a sensational victory over the Germans in the final. Beresford and Southwood got together again in 1939 when a double sculls event was introduced to mark the centenary of the Henley Regatta and they dead-heated with the Italian pair, Scherli and Broschi, who were the reigning European champions. This was Dick Southwood’s only success at Henley but in 1933 he won the prestigious Wingfield Sculls for the sculling championship of the Thames and his time of 21 minutes 11 seconds stood as a course record for many years.

Through the 2006 Winter Olympics, Maxi Herber is still the youngest female Winter Olympic champion at 15 years, 127 days. She began skating pairs in 1934 with Ernst Baier, winning the German Championships that year. Together they eventually won five German titles (1934-36, 1938-39), five European Championships (1935-39), four World Championships (1936-39) and the Olympic gold medal in 1936. Skating historians note that they raised pairs skating in terms of technical difficulty and artistic flow, revolutionizing pair skating by performing the first side by side jumps in competition. In 1941 Baier and Herber were married, but they divorced in 1964. After World War II they skated in ice revues and built up an own revue which they later sold to )Holiday on Ice.) As a result of the divorce, she had to depend on social services to survive, and suffered from Parkinson’s disease in her later years. In 2000 she moved to the Lenzheim retirement home in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and soon afterwards had an exhibition of her water colour paintings there. She died at age 86 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen; at that time having been Germany's oldest living female Olympic champion.

Baier is the only male skater to win Olympic medals in both pairs and singles competitions.


The composer at the end 


Thirty-year-old Berlin architect Ernst Baier and his 15-year-old protégée, Maxi Herber, were early exponents of ""shadow skating"" in which both skaters perform the exact same moves without touching. In an unusual reversal of normal procedure, the German government made a film of Baier and Herber's routine and commissioned a composer to create a piece to match their moves. 


Pairs and singles skating champion 


Ernst and Maxi gained the first place votes of seven of the nine judges and won gold medals easily at the 1936 Olympic Winter Games. The day after Ernst Baier was awarded his gold medal in the pairs event, he competed in the singles and earned a silver medal behind Karl Schäfer of Austria. 


World champions and an abrupt ending 


He and Herber went on to win the pairs world championship each year through 1939, after which their streak was ended by World War II and the two turned professional.

Fritz Feierabend was one of Switzerland’s greatest athletes to never win an Olympic gold medal. He joined the Swiss national bobsledding team in 1933 and had his first major international success at the 1935 World Championships, where he won a bronze medal  in the four-man alongside Reto Capadrutt and the non-Olympians A. Lardi and H. Tami. Feierabend and Capadrutt then travelled to the 1936 Winter Olympics where, with Hans Aichele and Hans Bütikofer, they captured a silver medal in the four-man. Feierabend and Joseph Beerli also took silver in the two-man event. This duo then earned bronze at the 1938 World Championships, while Feierabend had his first major international victory a year later, capturing gold in the four-man at the 1939 edition alongside Beerli and the non-Olympians Heinz Cattani and Alphonse Hörning.


Feierabend’s career was interrupted by World War II, but he returned in top form at the 1947 World Championships and won both the two- (with Stephan Waser ) and four-man (alongside Beerli, Cattani, and Hörning) events. His next stop was the 1948 Winter Olympics, where he took silver in the two-man with Paul Eberhard and finished fourth in the four-man alongside Heiri Angst, Felix Endrich, and Fritz Waller. The latter event would be the only Olympic one in which Feierabend would fail to medal over his career.


At the 1949 World Championships, Feierabend and Angst earned silver in the two-man and, with Waller and Werner Spring, bronze in the four-man. One year later Feierabend and Waser won the two-man and, alongside Albert Madörin and the non-Olympian Romi Spada, earned silver in the four-man. After coming up empty at the 1951 World Championships, Feierabend and Waser captured bronze in both the two- and four-man events at the 1952 Winter Olympics, aided in the latter by Madörin and André Filippini. Feierabend did not receive any medals at the 1953 World Championships, but then won the four-man the following year with Angst, Gottfried Diener, and Harry Warburton. His last major international championship was the 1955 World Championships, where he and Warburton took gold in the two-man and silver in the four-man alongside Aby Gartmann and Rolf Gerber. Feierabend retired from active competition with five Swiss national championships under his belt. By career he was involved in his father’s bobsled-building business and, together, they built the first all-steel bobsleigh.

Joseph Beerli was proficient in both skeleton and bobsleigh, but it was his prowess in the latter that brought him international fame. He first gained attention at the 1935 World Championships, where he earned silver in the four-man event alongside Charles Bouvier, Noldi Gartmann, and Pierre Musy. This quartet then travelled to the 1936 Winter Olympics, where they won the four-man and Beerli took silver in the two-man with Swiss bobsledding legend Fritz Feierabend. Beerli and Feierabend captured bronze in the two-man at the 1938 World Championships and gold in the four-man at the 1939 World Championships, alongside the non-Olympians Heinz Cattani and Alphonse Hörning. World War II interrupted Beerli’s career but, despite being well into his 40s at the conflict’s conclusion, he returned to the international bobsledding scene and helped his crew defend their four-man crown at the 1947 World Championships. He retired from active competition shortly thereafter and resumed working at his sports shop, a business that he owned and operated until his death in September 1967.

Dick Lawrence competed in both bobsled events at the 1936 Olympics and although he won a medal in the ‘boblet’ he was a hero in the 4-man. The 4-man sled, driven by Frank Tyler, began to gain too much speed for one turn and his brakeman, Jim Bickford, was thrown backwards, was half out of the sled and was being dangerously dragged along. Although he could also have fallen out, Lawrence leaned backwards, grabbed Bickford, and pulled him back into the sled. They finished the run. In addition to the 1936 Olympic bronze medal, Lawrence also partnered Gil Colgate to the 1934 North American 2-man championship.

Garrett Gilmore started rowing in 1919 when he joined the Bachelor’s Barge Club. His first national titles came the following year when he won in some junior and intermediate shells. But Gilmore won many titles as a senior, including five national senior titles in the single sculls and several more in the doubles. At the 1924 Olympics he was beaten by the great British oarsman, Jack Beresford, but at the 1932 Olympics he teamed with Ken Myers to take the gold medal.

Herbert Buhtz won a silver medal in double sculls in 1932, together with Gerhard Boetzelen, but he refrained from participating in single sculls because of a dental ulcer. Two years before the Los Angeles Games he argued with his longtime double sculls partner Gerhard von Düsterlho, and they split up. In addition, the Berlin RC rower won the Henley Regatta Diamond Sculls in 1932 and 1934, was European Champion in the coxed eights in 1937-38, German champion in double sculls from 1929-31, in single sculls in 1931 and 1935, and in the coxed fours in 1933. Buhtz went to Brazil in 1951 to coach, but later returned to Berlin. After World War II, he was the founding chairman at the re-establishment of the Berliner RC and the Berlin RV 1881 (today Berlin LRV). From 1958 Buhtz coached Berlin RC, later being made an honorary member. He was a dentist by profession.

Ned Pratt drew attention on the Canadian rowing scene in the early 1930s and was selected, alongside Noël de Mille, to represent his country in the double sculls at the 1932 Summer Games after winning the Olympic trials. In doing so they defeated Bob Richards, a gold medalist in the event at the 1930 British Empire Games, and Theo Dubois, whose rowing prowess would earn him the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s top athlete in 1941. At the Games, Pratt and de Mille won their heat over the Italians by a margin of eight seconds, but their times did not match those of the stronger American and German teams and, in the final, the Canadians settled for a bronze medal. Pratt was elected captain of his Vancouver Rowing Club the following year and continued to compete for the University of British Columbia until his graduation. He retired from his athletic career after the 1930s and began working as an architect, gaining attention for his works in the 1950s, particularly for his design of the British Columbia Electric Building. He had a considerable influence on the architecture of Vancouver during this era and remained active until his death in a traffic accident in February 1996. He and de Mille were inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame in 1980.

Hugh “Jumbo” Edwards went up to Christ Church College, Oxford from Westminster School and rowed in the Oxford boat as freshman in 1926 when his brother was also a member of the crew. Unfortunately, Edwards collapsed when the Dark Blues held a slight lead and Cambridge went on to win by five lengths. In 1927, Edwards was rusticated for failing his examinations and he then spent two years as a schoolmaster although he continued to row regularly with the London Rowing Club. While he was teaching, Edwards decided to follow his brother into the Royal Air Force and the only avenue open to him by which he could secure a permanent commission was to return to Oxford and obtain a University degree. So in 1930, Edwards went back to Oxford, took his degree and then joined the RAF the following year. During his second period at Oxford, he devoted more time to flying than to rowing and obtained Proctorial License No. 1 which enabled him to keep his private plane at the University. However, he was still good enough to command a place in the Oxford boat and five years after his first appearance he rowed again in the 1930 Boat Race. Referring to the 1930 race, Edwards later wrote, “I was incomparably the best oarsman in either crew” but apparently his Oxford colleagues could not match his talents as Cambridge won by two lengths. Later in 1930, Edwards was in the London Rowing Club crew that won the Grand and the Stewards’ at Henley and he then went to Canada for the British Empire Games where he won gold medals in the coxless fours and the eights. In 1931 he won three events at Henley – the Grand, the Stewards’ and the Goblets. At the 1932 Olympics he became only the second man in Olympic history to win two rowing gold medals on the same day. First he won the coxless pairs with Lewis Clive and then he was a member of the winning crew in the coxless fours, having been brought in as a late substitute for Thomas Tyler who contracted influenza after arriving in California. All these victories added up to a remarkable display of stamina for a man who had collapsed in the 1926 Boat Race.


After being commissioned into the RAF in 1931, Edwards became a well-known racing pilot and, in his own plane, finished second in the King’s Cup of 1935. During the war, he served with Coastal Command, winning the AFC in 1943 and the DFC the following year. In 1943 his rowing ability literally saved his life. Being forced to ditch his Liberator off Land’s End he rowed a dinghy for four miles before getting clear of the minefield in which he had landed. He was the only survivor of his crew. Group Captain Edwards retired from RAF in 1946 and soon developed a reputation as an innovative coach. He advised his old University on a number of occasions, including 1959 when his son David was in the Oxford crew, and he also coached Britain’s Olympic eight in 1960.Both David and his brother John were members of the Welsh coxless four that won medals at both the 1958 and 1962 Commonwealth Games.

After winning the goblets at Henley in 1931 and 1932, Lewis Clive and Hugh Edwards were selected to compete in the coxless pairs at the 1932 Olympics where the pair, from Christ Church College, Oxford, scored a comfortable victory in the Olympic final at Long Beach, California. On leaving Eton, where he achieved the rare distinction of being captain of both the Oppidans and Boats, Clive rowed for Oxford in 1931 and 1932 but, most unusually, he declined an invitation to become a member of the Leander Club. Lewis Clive, whose father, Lieutenant Col. PA Clive o the Grenadier Guards, died on active service in 1918 was himself killed in action while fighting in the Spanish Civil War. He was a man of strong political views, serving as a Labour member of Kensington Borough Council and writing books and pamphlets for the new Fabian Society. He had plans to stand for Parliament and it was his political conviction that took him to Spain where he met his death at the age of 27, fighting for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War.

He also won the coveted BSA Vase in 1930 and 1931. Many men before him had tried, and failed, to win it three times and make it their own personal property. Chambers pursued that goal until he was over 40, and like the others, also failed.


Chambers was the East Sussex Police one mile champion every year from 1930-38 with the exception of 1936, when he did not compete. However, his most memorable year was in 1932 when, with his brother Ernest, he finished second in the NCU One-mile Tandem Championship to Jack Sibbit and Dennis Horn. A few months later the siblings again finished second but this time on the larger stage at the Los Angeles Olympics -- it was Ernest’s second consecutive Olympic tandem silver medal. It would be another second place for the brothers at the 1933 national championships, when they were beaten by a mere 12 inches (30 cm) by Arthur Siers and Bob Meller.

In addition to their two Olympic pairs gold medals (1928, 1932), they were World Champions in 1926, 1928, 1930, and 1932, and runners-up in 1925. In 1932, the Brunets completed a Triple Crown by also winning the European Championships. Brunet was also the top French singles skater of his era, winning the French national title in 1924-25 and 1927-31. He competed at both the 1924 and 1928 Winter Olympics in singles, finishing 8th and 7th, respectively, and also placed 9th individually at the 1931 World Championships. 


After their competitive careers ended, the couple settled in the United States where they skated in ice shows and coached skating, with Carol Heiss and Scott Hamilton among their pupils. The Brunets had a child, Jean-Pierre, one of the very few skaters to ever defeat Dick Button, but he died in a car accident when only 19-years-old.

Beatrix Loughran is the only American to have won three Olympic medals in figure skating (two silver, one bronze). In 1924, she was third at the World Championships in the ladies’ singles. In addition, she was the U.S. women’s champion in 1925, 1926 and 1927, and won the U.S. pairs title from 1930 until 1932, partnering with Sherwin Badger. It was with Badger that she won the 1932 Olympic pairs silver medal, and bronze at the 1930 and 1932 World Championships. Later Loughran coached her niece 1936 Olympian Audrey Peppe. In 1997 she was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

Sherwin Badger was the first great American skater. He was a five-time U.S. individual champion – all in succession (1920-24) and in 1923 won the first North American championship. But his Olympic success came in pairs skating when, in 1932, he partnered with Beatrix Loughran to a silver medal. At the US Championships they won the title from 1930-1932. Previously, Badger skated in pairs events with painter Clara Frothingham and subsequently with her sister Edith Eliot Rotch, better known as a tennis player. With both he was runner-up at the US Championships in 1918 and 1920, respectively. 


Badger had studied at Harvard University, graduating in 1923. His business career began that year with United Fruit Co., but in 1925 he joined Dow-Jones Publications as the banking editor of The Wall Street Journal and Barrons. In 1940 he joined the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co., and remained with that firm, serving eventually as a senior vice-president and director, until his retirement in 1972. Badger stayed close to the sport after his competing days were over and served as president of the U.S. National Figure Skating Assoc. in the 1930s. Badger's first wife was Mary Bancroft, who after their divorce and during World War II, worked as a spy in Switzerland for the United States' OSS (Office of Strategic Services), the forerunner of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).

In a close contest with the Brunets of France, they failed to take the gold at the 1932 Olympic and World Championships, placing third and second respectively. They then won three World Championships in a row (1933-1935) and the 1934 European crown, but again failed to win at the Olympics, this time losing out to the home favourites Herber and Baier. The sixfold Hungarian champions retired after that season. Rotter later worked as an administrator at the University of Technology in Budapest.

Jack Sibbit was a member of the famous Manchester Wheelers cycling club, and became one of the leading British sprinters in the 1920s and 30s, equally at home on grass, cinder or cement tracks. The son of an Ancoats (Manchester) butcher, Jack started racing in 1914, but then served with the Royal Naval Air Service during World War I. He returned to racing after being demobilized in 1919, and the following year was third in the NCU Quarter-mile Championship before going on to win his first National title when he captured the 5-mile track title in 1922. He went on to win a total of 14 National titles including the 25-mile track title (1929), 1,000-yard sprint (1931-32), the quarter-mile title on two more occasions (1925 and 1927) and the tandem title eight times between 1924 and 1937 (including five in succession 1928-32). Ernest Chambers was his partner in five of those tandem victories, including his eighth and last one, when Sibbit was 42-years-of-age. The two men competed together at the 1928 and 1936 Olympics, winning a silver medal in the first of those years.


Sibbit also won the coveted Manchester Wheelers Muratti Gold Cup in 1925 and 1930, and the Dunlop Gold Cup three years in succession, 1927-29. He had a second and third place finish in the Copenhagen (København) Grand Prix and was selected for every World Championship 1922-32. After a 25-year career, Sibbit retired in 1939 at the age of 44, took up coaching youngsters, and also became an NCU cycling official.


During his racing career, Sibbit opened his first cycle shop in Manchester, specialising in making frames and wheels for himself and other crack riders of the day. The Jack Sibbit Memorial Sprint, over 1,000 metres, was set up in his honour.

Although he was an accomplished sprinter in his own right, Ernest Chambers’ successes at the Olympic Games came in the tandem sprint events. Paired with Jack Sibbit they reached the final in 1928 in Amsterdam but were beaten by the pair from the host country in slightly controversial circumstances. Some thought the Dutch duo blocked the Britons in the final stages.


Chambers partnered his brother Stanley at the 1932 Games and, after losing to the French pair in round one, battled their way to the final only to lose their rematch with the French. He reunited with Sibbit for an unsuccessful campaign at the Berlin Olympics before retiring. In later life he ran a cycle shop in the London borough of Mitcham.

In 1926 and 1927 Köther sr. became German champion over one and ten kilometres. As an amateur he won more than 400 races before he turned professional in 1933. In 1936 he retired from racing but became the director of the Hannover Six Days race and was manager of the Hannover-Wülfel velodrome.

Jack Guest took up rowing in 1924 and, by 1928, was good enough to compete in the Diamond Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, then the equivalent of a world championship in the single sculls. He was defeated in the semifinals by another Canadian, Joe Wright, Jr., but decided to join with Wright to form a double sculls crew capable of contending at that year’s Summer Olympics. At the Games they survived to the finals, where they were defeated by the American duo of Charley McIlvaine and Paul Costello, and took home a silver medal. Guest was Canadian champion in the single sculls in 1929, but lost again to Wright at the Diamond Sculls, who was in turn defeated by Bert Gunther of the Netherlands in the final. Guest then embarked upon an intense, year-long training regimen and entered the Diamond Sculls again in 1930. This time he did not meet Wright, but instead faced Gerhard Boetzelen of Germany in the finals, who had earlier bested Wright. Guest triumphed easily and retired from active competition immediately after.


Guest remained active on the rowing scene as an administrator, most notably as the president of the Don Rowing Club of Mississauga, where he had spent most of his non-Olympic competitive career, from 1938 through 1952. He also managed the Canadian rowing delegations to the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 1962 and 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and was the first Canadian representative at the International Federation of Rowing Associations. Additionally, he was director of the Canadian Olympic Committee (then the Canadian Olympic Association) from 1960 through 1968. He was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955. The Jack Guest award is given annually to the junior single sculler of the year by Rowing Canada. His son, Jack Guest, Jr., was also an elite rower who would have competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics if not for an injury that required surgery.

A top player in all age groups, renowned coach and administrator, and donor of the Wightman Cup, Hazel Wightman was one of the legendary figures of lawn tennis. In 1912, Hazel Hotchkiss married George Wightman, who later became the president of the USLTA, and although she gave birth to three children during the following seven years, she still won a total of 16 U.S. championships between 1909 and 1928. She would win 50 national titles in all. She donated the Wightman Cup as the trophy for an international team match between the best female amateurs of Britain and the U.S., and the first competition for the cup was held in 1923. Hazel not only was the donor of the cup that year, but she played on the U.S. team, a feat she repeated in 1924, 1927, 1929, and 1931. Though in recent years the competition has been rather one-sided, the Wightman Cup is still a coveted trophy. In 1924, Hazel Wightman journeyed to Paris, where she opted not to play in the Olympic ladies' singles event. She saved her best for the ladies' and mixed doubles events and partnered Dick Williams and Helen Wills to comfortable victories in those events. Though in later years she continued to play tennis, and win championships, she also became a well-known coach, numbering among her pupils Marion Zinderstein Jessup and Helen Wills-Moody. At the Jubilee Wightman Cup match at Boston in 1973, Hazel Wightman was accorded perhaps her greatest honor – an Honorary C.B.E.

Although he was the only triple medal winner in the 1924 Olympic lawn tennis events, he survived some desperately close matches. Of the five matches Richards played on the way to the singles title, three went to five sets and another to four sets. Both the semi-final and the final of the men’s doubles went to five sets and, adding in his mixed doubles schedule, it is not surprising that Richards lost 18 lbs. (8 kg.) during the tournament.

The best male pre-War tennis player from the Netherlands, Henk Timmer twice reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon (1927, 1929). His top world ranking was 6th, in 1930. Timmer had a 43-22 Davis Cup record, playing the 1925 final (a 0-4 loss to France) and the 1923 and 1928 semi-finals. In national championships, he won 23 titles, including 9 in men's singles. At the 1924 Olympics, Timmer was eliminated in the early rounds of singles and doubles play, but in mixed doubles he reached the semi-finals with Kea Bouman. After losing to Marion Jessup and Vinnie Richards, they won the match for bronze in a walk-over. Timmer missed the opportunity to play at the 1928 Olympics when the IOC suspended tennis from the Games in a dispute over professionalism just before the Olympics. Apart from tennis, Henk Timmer was also a good squash player; in 1941 he became the inaugural Dutch champion. Timmer, who was also a decent golf player and speed skater, worked as an insurance agent. He died in 1998, just four days before his 1924 doubles partner Bouman.

A top player in all age groups, renowned coach and administrator, and donor of the Wightman Cup, Hazel Wightman was one of the legendary figures of lawn tennis. In 1912, Hazel Hotchkiss married George Wightman, who later became the president of the USLTA, and although she gave birth to three children during the following seven years, she still won a total of 16 U.S. championships between 1909 and 1928. She would win 50 national titles in all. She donated the Wightman Cup as the trophy for an international team match between the best female amateurs of Britain and the U.S., and the first competition for the cup was held in 1923. Hazel not only was the donor of the cup that year, but she played on the U.S. team, a feat she repeated in 1924, 1927, 1929, and 1931. Though in recent years the competition has been rather one-sided, the Wightman Cup is still a coveted trophy. In 1924, Hazel Wightman journeyed to Paris, where she opted not to play in the Olympic ladies' singles event. She saved her best for the ladies' and mixed doubles events and partnered Dick Williams and Helen Wills to comfortable victories in those events. Though in later years she continued to play tennis, and win championships, she also became a well-known coach, numbering among her pupils Marion Zinderstein Jessup and Helen Wills-Moody. At the Jubilee Wightman Cup match at Boston in 1973, Hazel Wightman was accorded perhaps her greatest honor – an Honorary C.B.E.

Rated by many authorities as the greatest woman player of her era, Helen Wills Moody won a total of 31 titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. and French championships. She came east from California while still a pigtailed teenager to win her first major title in 1922. She would eventually win eight Wimbledon and seven U.S. singles titles, with her last being the Wimbledon championship in 1938. This impressive total of victories was accomplished despite the fact that she did not play in the U.S. championships after 1933 because of an estrangement with the authorities. 


Helen Wills won the Olympic singles in 1924 without the loss of a set and added a second gold medal by taking the doubles with her coach, Hazel Wightman, who was almost 20 years her senior. Helen Wills was educated at the University of California (Berkeley). She also competed in the 1932 Olympic Arts Competition as a painter, but also wrote poems and illustrated books.

Phyllis Howkins was the daughter of a wealthy Berkshire flour miller. She made her Wimbledon début in 1920 and a year later reached the mixed doubles final with Max Woosnam but lost 3-6, 1-6 to Randolph Lycett (Great Britain) and Elizabeth Ryan (USA). She also enjoyed her best performance in the singles that year, losing to fellow Briton Phyllis Satterthwaite in the quarter-final. Phyllis married Beverley Covell in India in 1921 and in 1923 she won her only Grand Slam title when she captured the US doubles with Kitty McKane after beating the Americans Hazel Wightman and Eleanor Goss in three sets after losing the first set. Also in 1923 she appeared in the first Wightman Cup match against the United States and was a member of the first winning British team a year later when she won her two singles, against Helen Wills and Molla Mallory and, with Dorothy Shepherd-Barron, won the doubles as Great Britain won 6-1. She was the playing captain of the side in 1929.


Covell was runner-up at Wimbledon in 1924, again with McKane, and in 1929 was runner-up in three Grand Slam events - the ladies’ doubles with Dorothy Shepherd-Barron at the US Open and at Wimbledon, and in the mixed doubles at the US  championships with Bunny Austin. She won the silver medal in doubles at the 1924 Olympics with Kitty McKane after a valiant effort in pushing the Americans Wightman and Wills before losing the final 7-5, 8-6.

With a bronze in the singles, a silver in the mixed doubles and a gold in the women’s doubles, Kitty McKane acquired a full set of medals at the 1920 Olympic Games. Her bronze medal in the 1920 singles was won in unique circumstances: as she wished to be at her best to partner Winifred McNair in the doubles she conceded a walkover in the semi-final fog the singles but still qualified to play in the match which she duly won against Sigrid Fick of Sweden to take the bronze medal. She won two more medals at the 1924 Games in Paris but despite a total of five Olympic medals she will be remembered for more notable successes in wider files. Although London-born, Kitty McKane learned her tennis at St. Leonard’s School in Scotland and made her tournament début at Roehampton in April 1919. A few weeks later she reached the quarter-finals on her first appearance at Wimbledon and soon took over the role of Britain’s number one player from Dorothy Lambert Chambers. By 1924 she had established herself as a world class player and confirmed her status by beating the great Helen Wills in the Wightman Cup, repeating the feat at Wimbledon a few days later. In a classic Wimbledon final, McKane lost the first set and trailed 1-4 in the second but came back to hand Helen Wills her only defeat in a singles match in nine appearances at Wimbledon.


In January 1926, Kitty McKane married Leslie Godfree while they were on a tennis tour of South Africa and later that year they achieved the ultimate in familial success by becoming the only husband and wife pairing ever to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon. In 1926 she also won her second Wimbledon singles title and reached the final of the women’s doubles for the third time, the first time having been in 1922 when she was partnered by her sister, Margaret Stocks. Although she never succeeded in wining the women’s doubles at Wimbledon, McKane had a fine record in other major championship doubles, winning the US title in 1923 and 1927 and the US mixed doubles in 1925.


Kathleen McKane Godfree’s record as a tennis player was matched by her success at badminton. She won eight All-England titles (four singles, two doubles and two mixed), her victories in the doubles coming with her sister, Margaret, as her partner. Her sporting talents were not restricted to racket games, as a nine-year-old she cycled 600 miles from London to Berlin on a family “outing” the following year she was awarded the bronze medal of the National Skating Association in 1914 she was selected to play for England against Scotland in the lacrosse international but the game was called off due to the outbreak of war.

Dorothy Shepherd-Barron made her Wimbledon début as Dorothy Shepherd at the age of 22 in 1920 and, apart from a brief spell when she lived and played her tennis in India after her marriage to engineer William Barron in 1921, she was a regular competitor at Wimbledon up to the outbreak of World War II. She appeared in seven Grand Slam doubles finals, winning just one.


In the mixed doubles Shepherd-Barron lost at Wimbledon in 1923, 1924 and 1934 and was also runner-up in the French Championship in 1931. In the ladies doubles Dorothy and Phyllis Covell were beaten in both the Wimbledon and US Championship finals in 1929 by another British pair, Peggy Saunders and Phoebe Watson. But Shepherd-Barron’s moment of glory came at Wimbledon in 1931 when, partnering Phyllis Mudford King, the unseeded British pair beat the fourth seeds Doris Metaxa (France) and Josane Sigart (Belgium) in three sets after losing the first.


Dorothy appeared at the 1924 Olympics, taking part in both the singles and ladies doubles. She reached the singles quarter-final but lost to French girl Julie Vlasto in straight sets. She finished third in the doubles with Evelyn Colyer after beating the French pair Marguerite Broquedis-Billout and Yvonne Bourgeois in the bronze medal match.


A Wightman Cup player, Shepherd-Barron played in 1924, 1926 and 1929 and was the playing captain in 1931. She was also the non-playing captain in 1932, 1950,1951 and 1952 and almost certainly would have had the position in 1953 had it not been for her untimely death in February 1953 following an accident when a car driven by her husband hit some railings in Cambridgeshire and caught fire. Dorothy died but her husband escaped unhurt. Dorothy’s son John Shepherd-Barron was involved in the development of the first cash dispensing machine to be installed in Britain, at Barclay’s Bank, Enfield on 27 June 1967.

Evelyn Colyer was the oldest daughter of Sir Frank Colyer, an eminent dental surgeon. She first attracted attention with partner Joan Austin when they reached the Wimbledon doubles final in 1923. Dubbed “The Babes” by the media, because their combined age was just over 41 years, they were no match for the powerful pair of Suzanne Lenglen and Helen Wills in the final as the French/American duo won 6-3, 6-1. Colyer travelled to Paris for the 1924 Olympics where she won the bronze medal in the doubles with Dorothy Shepherd-Barron. She also made her Wightman Cup début in the first winning Great Britain team in 1924. She was also on the winning team the following year but in 1926 Colyer and Kitty McKane  lost the deciding doubles, after winning the first set, to hand the Americans a 4-3 victory. With McKane she was runner-up in the French championship in 1925 and a year later was the beaten finalist at both the French and Wimbledon championships. She enjoyed a rare moment of singles success in 1926 when she won the Queen’s Club covered court title.


Evelyn Colyer met Indian tea planter Hamish Munro on a skiing trip in Switzerland and five weeks later, in February 1930, they married and moved to India. On 27 October 1930 she gave birth to twins, a boy and girl, but a week later Evelyn sadly died, as did the twins. She had retired from tennis after her marriage and had previously turned down offers to turn professional and also declined the offer of a stage career.

He was a student at Fordham Prep at the time and later attended Fordham University and Columbia University. Richards went on to win four more U.S. men’s doubles titles, and he won once at Wimbledon, once at the French championships, and took the U.S. mixed doubles twice. Although he was the only triple medal winner in the 1924 Olympic lawn tennis events, he survived some desperately close matches. Of the five matches Richards played on the way to the singles title, three went to five sets and another to four sets. Both the semi-final and the final of the men’s doubles went to five sets and, adding in his mixed doubles schedule, it is not surprising that Richards lost 18 lbs. (8 kg.) during the tournament. After the Davis Cup matches of 1926, Vinnie Richards turned professional at the age of 23 and won the first U.S. pro singles title.

Hunter went out of the 1924 Olympic singles in the third round. In the doubles he was joined by Vinnie Richards and after a five-setter in the semi-final against Jean Borotra and Rene Lacoste of France and a final, which also went the full distance, against two more Frenchmen Jacques Brugnon and Henri Cochet – the U.S. pairing took the Olympic title. Hunter and Richards had won the Wimbledon doubles earlier in the season and Hunter won again at Wimbledon in 1927 with Bill Tilden as his partner. Hunter and Tilden also won the U.S. doubles in 1927 and they played together in the Davis Cup in 1927 and 1928.

Henri Cochet was the world’s #1 ranked player from 1928-31, and was considered one of the “Four Musketeers” that elevated the game in France, along with René Lacoste, Jean Borotra, and Jacques Brugnon. Cochet won seven of the current Grand Slam Championships, winning the French four times (1926, 1928, 1930, 1932), Wimbledon twice (1927, 1929), and the US Championship once (1928). In his era, he also won three other tournaments then considered majors, two World Covered Court Championships (1922-23), and one World Hard Court Championship (1922). Cochet turned professional in 1933 but without much success and was reinstated as an amateur in 1946.


In Davis Cup play Cochet and the Four Musketeers led France to six consecutive titles, from 1927-32. In doubles play he won five Grand Slams, the 1927, 1930, and 1932 French titles, and the 1926 and 1928 Wimbledon titles. Cochet spent part of World War II as a captive of the Nazis, but returned to play high-level tennis after the war, although not approaching his previous brilliance. He later ran a sporting goods store in Paris and coached the French youth tennis program. In 1951 Cochet was given the Red Ribbon of the French Legion of Honour for his sporting achievements. He and the entire Four Musketeers were inducted together into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1976.

Borotra won 9 French Open titles (including two singles) and six at Wimbledon. He played only once at the U.S. Open, losing the final to Lacoste and winning the mixed doubles. A member of the French Socialist Party (PSF), he served as commissioner for education and sports in Vichy France, but was captured by the Germans in 1942, remaining imprisoned for the remainder of the Second World War.

René Lacoste was named the world's #1 tennis player in 1926 and 1927, but nowadays he is probably better known for the Lacoste clothing brand, which started in 1929 with a tennis shirt bearing the logo of a crocodile (or alligator). This was taken from Lacoste's nickname, with various stories surrounding the origin of the name. Besides the shirt, Lacoste also revolutionized the tennis world by inventing the first steel racket in 1936. One the court, Lacoste was highly successful. Together with three other French players (Borotra, Cochet and Brugnon), dubbed the ""Four Musketeers"", he won the Davis Cup in 1927 and 1928. He took three singles titles at Roland Garros, and two at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. In addition, he won three Grand Slam doubles titles. In 1929, he married French golfer Simone de la Chaume.

His career spanned more than two decades, during which he remained an amateur - he saw no need to earn money with his activities. He never won a major title. He thought to have a decent shot at the title in 1914, with his archrival William Bailey having turned pro. However, the tournament was cancelled halfway when World War I broke out. Bosch van Drakestein quit cyling after the Amsterdam Olympics, at age 41. In the 1930ies, Bosch van Drakenstein was instrumental in the removal of a Jewish administrator of the Dutch Cycling Union.

His last major success came in 1924 with the Paris bronze medal in the tandem together with Gerard Bosch van Drakestein. Peeters was known to have a cognac before each race, but before the Olympic tandem final, he emptied the entire bottle, which explained his strange performance and the fact that he was grinning and smiling strangely after the race.

Together they won 10 consecutive French crowns in pairs skating (1924-33). In addition to their two Olympic pairs gold medals (1928, 1932), they were World Champions in 1926, 1928, 1930, and 1932, and runners-up in 1925. In 1932, the Brunets completed a Triple Crown by also winning the European Championships. Brunet-Joly was also the top French singles skater of her era, winning the French national title from 1921-30. She competed at both the 1924 and 1928 Winter Olympics in singles, finishing 5th and 11th, respectively. After their competitive careers ended, the couple settled in the United States where they skated in ice shows and coached skating, with Carol Heiss and Scott Hamilton among their pupils. The Brunets had a child, Jean-Pierre, one of the very few skaters to ever defeat Dick Button, but he died in a car accident when only 19-years-old.

Harry Ryan who was born “over the shop” of the family business in the Euston Road enjoyed a top-class cycling career which began in 1913 with a runner-up placement in the World Amateur Sprint Championship and lasted a full decade. With his teammate from the Polytechnic CC, Thomas Lance, Ryan steered the British pairing to victory in the tandem event at the 1920 Olympics and also won a bronze medal in the 1,000 metre match sprint. Ryan won four NCU individual championships before the Antwerp Olympics and after the Games he won the 1921 and 1922 tandem title with Thomas Harvey of Catford CC as his partner. After he retired, Harry Ryan developed the well-known family machine tool business of Buck & Ryan into a highly successful concern and became a prominent official in the cycling world, attending most of the major meetings at home and on the Continent.

His victories included the mixed doubles in 1906 when he was partnered by his wife. Although the Olympic tournaments during that era attracted many of the world’s top players, Décugis’s greatest non-Olympic achievement was to win the Wimbledon doubles with his countryman André Gobert in 1911 when they defeated the previously unbeaten holders, Tony Wilding (NZL) and Major Josiah Ritchie (GBR).

With a bronze in the singles, a silver in the mixed doubles and a gold in the women’s doubles, Kitty McKane acquired a full set of medals at the 1920 Olympic Games. Her bronze medal in the 1920 singles was won in unique circumstances: as she wished to be at her best to partner Winifred McNair in the doubles she conceded a walkover in the semi-final fog the singles but still qualified to play in the match which she duly won against Sigrid Fick of Sweden to take the bronze medal. She won two more medals at the 1924 Games in Paris but despite a total of five Olympic medals she will be remembered for more notable successes in wider files. Although London-born, Kitty McKane learned her tennis at St. Leonard’s School in Scotland and made her tournament début at Roehampton in April 1919. A few weeks later she reached the quarter-finals on her first appearance at Wimbledon and soon took over the role of Britain’s number one player from Dorothy Lambert Chambers. By 1924 she had established herself as a world class player and confirmed her status by beating the great Helen Wills in the Wightman Cup, repeating the feat at Wimbledon a few days later. In a classic Wimbledon final, McKane lost the first set and trailed 1-4 in the second but came back to hand Helen Wills her only defeat in a singles match in nine appearances at Wimbledon.


In January 1926, Kitty McKane married Leslie Godfree while they were on a tennis tour of South Africa and later that year they achieved the ultimate in familial success by becoming the only husband and wife pairing ever to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon. In 1926 she also won her second Wimbledon singles title and reached the final of the women’s doubles for the third time, the first time having been in 1922 when she was partnered by her sister, Margaret Stocks. Although she never succeeded in wining the women’s doubles at Wimbledon, McKane had a fine record in other major championship doubles, winning the US title in 1923 and 1927 and the US mixed doubles in 1925.


Kathleen McKane Godfree’s record as a tennis player was matched by her success at badminton. She won eight All-England titles (four singles, two doubles and two mixed), her victories in the doubles coming with her sister, Margaret, as her partner. Her sporting talents were not restricted to racket games, as a nine-year-old she cycled 600 miles from London to Berlin on a family “outing” the following year she was awarded the bronze medal of the National Skating Association in 1914 she was selected to play for England against Scotland in the lacrosse international but the game was called off due to the outbreak of war.

Max Woosnam was a man of such talent and versatility that he must be ranked as one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of the British sport. He was an international or first-class player at association football, lawn tennis, golf, cricket, real tennis and racquets. Woosnam himself said ""If I was any good at anything, it was football"" but such were his achievements that it is advisable to review them chronologically rather than try to assess their respective merits.


Max Woosnam was educated at Winchester where he was captain of cricket and golf and played for the College at football and rackets. When he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge he played against Oxford at football, golf, lawn tennis and real tennis with perhaps the only surprise of his wonderful University career being his failure to win a fifth blue at cricket. In his freshman year, 1912, he played for the University in every game before losing his place at the last minute for the Oxford match and went to Lord's as 12th man.


After his sporting commitments at Cambridge were complete for the 1914 season, Woosnam went on the Corinthians FC tour of Brazil but no sooner had the team arrived in South America than the news arrived of the outbreak of war in Europe. The touring party spent just one night in Rio and took the next boat home. Within 24 hours of docking at Tilbury every man in the team was with the Colours, Woosnam joining the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry before transferring to the Royal Welch Fusiliers. After service in France, Woosnam left the Army early in 1919 and returned to Cambridge. He was elected captain of cricket that summer but he again failed to hold his place in the team for the match against Oxford and it was then that he decided to concentrate on lawn tennis. His victory in the men's doubles with Noel Turnbull at the 1920 Olympics was his first major success and in Antwerp he also won an Olympic silver medal in the mixed doubles partnering Kathleen “Kitty” McKane. Woosnam was also selected as a member of the association football squad for the 1920 Olympics but as the soccer tournament began as soon as the lawn tennis program ended, he felt he could not spend any more time away from his work and so withdrew. In May 1921 he made a winning Davis Cup début in the doubles against Spain with Randolph Lycett as his partner. The same pair went on to win the Wimbledon title in 1921. Woosnam was again a member of the Olympic team in 1924 but failed to repeat his successes of four years earlier, being eliminated in the early stages of the singles and the men's doubles.


During this golden era, Max Woosnam turned to football when the summers were over. Before the war, he had played for Chelsea while still an undergraduate but when he left Cambridge in 1919 he joined the staff at ICIC in Manchester and remained with the company until his retirement in 1954. He made 93 appearances for Manchester City between 1920 and 1925 and captained the team when they were runners-up for the First Division championship in 1920-21. Woosnam won three international caps in the 1921-1922 season, playing against Wales and Ireland in the amateur internationals and captaining the full international team, also against Wales. Woosnam was a dominating centre-half with a ferocious shoulder charge and in his three international appearances, England did not concede a single goal. Shortly after the game against Wales a broken leg ended his football career.

Ladislav Žemla played in five Olympic tennis tournaments (1906, 1908, 1912, 1920, 1924), and was the first tennis player to do so.

Žemla was twice a winner of the Budapest Championship, in 1906 and 1909. He also won the 1921 Hainz Memorial. In the 1900s he played at the Austrian International, and the Praha Invitational, making the semis in Austria in 1905. Žemla played once at Wimbledon, in 1926, losing in the third round of singles, the third round of doubles, and the second round of mixed. He also played at the 1922-23 World Hard Court Championships, losing in the third round in 1923.

He first came to prominence as a tennis player in 1919 and made his Davis Cup début that year. He played again in the Davis Cup in 1921 but then virtually gave up the game for four years to concentrate on golf in which he played off scratch at St. George’s Hill and West Hill. On resuming serious tennis, he again made the Davis Cup team in 1926 and won the singles at the Portuguese Championships in 1921 and 1928. He was, however essentially a doubles specialist and his victory with Max Woosnam in the 1920 Olympic doubles was undoubtedly his greatest achievement. He was a first cousin, once removed, to Philip Turnbull and Bertrand Turnbull.

Kumagae competed at the US Open in 1916 and played in 60 tournaments in the United States during a three-month tour, ranking #5 in the US that year. He continued to compete in the United States, ranking #3 in 1919, when he was world-ranked #7. He made the semi-finals at the 1918 US Open, and won the 1919 Great Lakes Championships, defeating Bill Tilden in the final.


Kumagae won two silver medals at the 1920 Olympics, in singles and doubles, partnered by Seiichiro Kashio in the latter. Kumagae captained the 1921 Japanese Davis Cup team, leading them to the final, where they lost to the United States, still the best finish ever for a Japanese Davis Cup squad through 2015.

After losing the first set, McNair and McKane won their semi-final and then took the final against the British pair, Geraldine Beamish and Dorothy Holman. Although Winifred McNair’s playing record could not match that of her distinguished partner she was not without successes of her own. She reached the finals of the All-Comers singles at Wimbledon in 1913 and won the doubles that year when partnered by Dora Boothby after their opponents, Dorothy Lambert Chambers and Charlotte Cooper, were forced to retire through injury when leading 6-4, 4-2.


Like her Olympic partner, Winifred McNair also had a second string to her sporting bow. Winifred was also an excellent golfer and when her tennis career was coming to an end she embarked on her next sporting career. She regularly played for Middlesex and represented England in the 1921 International Tournament at Turnberry, helping them to victory over Wales, Scotland and Ireland. She also competed in the England Ladies’ Championship several times in the 1920s and in 1925 reached the semi-final before losing to Doris Fowler.

With a bronze in the singles, a silver in the mixed doubles and a gold in the women’s doubles, Kitty McKane acquired a full set of medals at the 1920 Olympic Games. Her bronze medal in the 1920 singles was won in unique circumstances: as she wished to be at her best to partner Winifred McNair in the doubles she conceded a walkover in the semi-final fog the singles but still qualified to play in the match which she duly won against Sigrid Fick of Sweden to take the bronze medal. She won two more medals at the 1924 Games in Paris but despite a total of five Olympic medals she will be remembered for more notable successes in wider files. Although London-born, Kitty McKane learned her tennis at St. Leonard’s School in Scotland and made her tournament début at Roehampton in April 1919. A few weeks later she reached the quarter-finals on her first appearance at Wimbledon and soon took over the role of Britain’s number one player from Dorothy Lambert Chambers. By 1924 she had established herself as a world class player and confirmed her status by beating the great Helen Wills in the Wightman Cup, repeating the feat at Wimbledon a few days later. In a classic Wimbledon final, McKane lost the first set and trailed 1-4 in the second but came back to hand Helen Wills her only defeat in a singles match in nine appearances at Wimbledon.


In January 1926, Kitty McKane married Leslie Godfree while they were on a tennis tour of South Africa and later that year they achieved the ultimate in familial success by becoming the only husband and wife pairing ever to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon. In 1926 she also won her second Wimbledon singles title and reached the final of the women’s doubles for the third time, the first time having been in 1922 when she was partnered by her sister, Margaret Stocks. Although she never succeeded in wining the women’s doubles at Wimbledon, McKane had a fine record in other major championship doubles, winning the US title in 1923 and 1927 and the US mixed doubles in 1925.


Kathleen McKane Godfree’s record as a tennis player was matched by her success at badminton. She won eight All-England titles (four singles, two doubles and two mixed), her victories in the doubles coming with her sister, Margaret, as her partner. Her sporting talents were not restricted to racket games, as a nine-year-old she cycled 600 miles from London to Berlin on a family “outing” the following year she was awarded the bronze medal of the National Skating Association in 1914 she was selected to play for England against Scotland in the lacrosse international but the game was called off due to the outbreak of war.

Winifred Geraldine Ramsey was the eldest daughter, and one of six children of London Stock Exchange dealer Arthur Ramsey and his wife Fanny. Arthur was himself a good tennis player and in 1889 reached the final of the singles handicap at his club, Forest Gate LTC, but lost to a 15-year-old – Herbert Roper Barrett


Geraldine, as she preferred to be called, played at Wimbledon every year from 1910 to 1933, with the exception of the War years. From 1912 she played under the name Geraldine Beamish after marrying fellow player Alfred Ernest Beamish towards the end of the previous season. She reached the ladies singles final three times but lost to Briton Phyllis Satterthwaite in 1919, to Molla Mallory (USA) in 1922 and in 1923 she was whitewashed 6-0, 6-0 by the French star Suazanne Lenglen. And it was Lenglen and partner Elizabeth Ryan of the United States, who ended Beamish’s only chance of Wimbledon glory in 1921 by beating her and Irene Peacock of South Africa in the ladies doubles instraight sets.


Geraldne entered all three events at the 1920 Olympics and won a silver medal in the doubles with Dorothy Holman, but they lost the final to fellow Britons Kitty McKane and Winifred McNair. However, Beamish won the world covered court singles title that same year by beating McKane in three sets. She was also three times the world covered court doubles champion, with Kitty McKane each time, and in 1919 she won the mixed doubles title with Frenchman Max Décugis.

Dorothy Holman reached the ladies singles final at the 1920 Olympics but lost 6-3, 6-0 to Suzanne Lenglen. It was to remain the biggest win in an Olympics ladies singles final until Serena Williams beat Mariya Sharapova to win her first singles gold in 2012. Holman won a second silver in the ladies doubles with Geraldine Beamish when they were beaten in the final by another British pair, Kitty McKane and Winifred McNair. Dorothy won the Queen’s Club Championship (then known as the London Championship) in 1920 when the holder Ethel Larcombe scratched from the final. Dorothy was also runner-up in the championship on three occasions.


Between 1912 and 1925 Dorothy Holman won 22 titles, which included four British Covered court titles in 1912, 1914, 1921 and 1922. But her biggest triumph was in beating Germaine Goulding of France 6-3, 6-4 to capture the World covered court championship in Paris in 1919. Her best performance at Wimbledon was in reaching the semi-final on two occasions. Losing to Charlotte Sterry in three sets in 1912 and in 1913 when she again lost in three sets, to Winifred McNair. She also twice reached the ladies doubles semi-final.


A portrait of Dorothy was hung in the National Portrait Gallery in 1924.

Yngvar Bryn is one of the pioneers of the Norwegian sport history. He was born in Kristiansand as the youngest of six siblings, and his father, a military captain, died when Yngvar was one year of age. At the age of 18, Yngvar won silver medals at the 1899 Norwegian Athletic Championships in the 100 and 500 m, and in 1901 he won the 500 m national championship almost four seconds ahead of his nearest opponent. After his impressive victory he was selected to represent Norway in the nation’s first ever Olympic team for the Paris Olympics 1900. He participated in the 200 m and 400 m race, but was eliminated in the first round. In 1902 we won his second national champion title by repeating his 500 m victory from 1900. In 1902 he set a Norwegian record for the 100 metres with 11.1 – but the record was beaten to 11.0 eight days later.


Bryn was elected president of the Norwegian Athletic Federation at the age of 26 in 1908, and served three years in this position. At the same time his athlete career had switched from athletics to figure skating. Together with his wife Alexia Bryn (they married in 1912) he was national champion 11 times in pairs skating, from 1908-13, and 1919-22. At the 1920 Antwerp Olympics he was present as an athlete in April, earning a silver medal together with Alexia in pair skating. In August he went to the Games once more, this time as team leader for the Norwegian Track and Field team. He was a member of the Judges Committee of the International Skating Union from 1923-25, and served as an ISU council member from 1925-27. Bryn was elected president of the Norwegian Skating Association from 1926-27. In 1932 he acted as a figure skating judge at the Lake Placid winter Olympics. He was a versatile sportsman, also doing swimming, gymnastics, skiing and fencing. Yngvar Bryn studied philology at Oslo University, and worked as a high school teacher until his death in 1947 at the age of 65.

Phyllis Squire was eighteen years of age when she married James Johnson, a colliery owner ten years her elder, in 1904. Together they formed a partnership that saw them win two world titles, a silver (1908) and a bronze (1910) world championship medal and the 1908 Olympic silver medal until his ill health caused the end of their skating relationship.She then skated with a new partner, Basil Williams, at the Antwerp Olympics and became the first skater to win a medal with two different partners when they clinched the bronze medal. Johnson also competed as a singles skater at Antwerp and narrowly missed a medal as she finished in fourth place. She had previously placed second in the ladies event at the 1913 World Championships and won bronze in both 1912 and 1914. As Phyllis Squire, she had started out in the English style of skating, winning the Challenge Shield in 1902-1904 and the English Challenge Cup in 1904. After James Johnson died she re-married and lived on into her eighties.

As the outdoor lawn tennis events at the 1912 Olympics coincided with Wimbledon, Great Britain was not represented in this part of the program but they did send a strong team to the Olympic indoor events in May. The most successful member of this team was Edith Hannam who won the two gold medals. In the singles final, she beat Sofie Castenschiold of Denmark in straight sets and then joined Charles Dixon to take the mixed doubles title. Edith Boucher came from a prominent Gloucestershire family and her four brothers were all notable sportsmen in the area. In May 1909 she married Francis Hannam, after which she gave up tennis for a while when the newly married coupled settled in Canada where her husband pursued his business interests as a timber merchant. The Hannam’s did not stay long in Canada and on their return Edith became an outstanding figure at the Welsh Championships, winning a total of ten titles between 1912 and 1923. She enjoyed mixed fortunes at Wimbledon, her best years being 1911, when she reached the All Comers singles final, and 1914 when, with Ethel Larcombe as her partner, she was a finalist in the women’s doubles. Her husband was killed in action in 1916 when serving as a captain in the Gloucestershire Regiment.

In an all-British final, Charles Dixon and Edith Hannam beat Roper Barrett and Helen Aitchison to take the mixed doubles covered court title at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm. Mrs. Hannam had earlier won the women’s singles and Dixon had already made his mark on the tournament with an outstanding win over the reigning Wimbledon champion, Tony Wilding of New Zealand, in the semi-finals of the men’s singles. In the singles final, Dixon went down in straight sets to André Gobert of France but completed his set of Olympic medals by wining a bronze in the men’s doubles. Charles Dixon reached the All-Comers final of the singles at Wimbledon in 1901 and 1911 but he did not win a Wimbledon title until two months after the 1912 Olympics when the 39-year-old veteran won the Wimbledon doubles with Roper Barrett. He then took the 1912 Australian doubles title with James Parke and concluded a memorable year by captaining the team which recaptured the Davis Cup from Australasia. In 1913 Dixon and Roper Barrett successfully defended their Wimbledon title. Charles Dixon was educated at Haileybury and Clare College, Cambridge before becoming a solicitor. He played in four Davis Cup ties and while at Cambridge won a blue for Rackets, but surprisingly, not for lawn tennis. He was also a scratch golfer and his sporting talents were shared by his brother, John, who captained Nottinghamshire at cricket for many years and won an England cap at soccer.

Helen Aitchison was the eldest daughter of a Sunderland shipbuilder and was one of four tennis-playing sisters. Helen, along with siblings Alice, Kathleen and Sibyl were four of the six members of the Durham team that beat a strong Middlesex team, containing Dorothea Lambert Chambers, 5-4 in the final of the Women’s County Championship at Newcastle in 1907. Two years later, Helen won the All-England Ladies Doubles championship at Buxton when she and partner Agnes Tuckey came from one set down to beat Maud Garfit and Hilda Lane. This is regarded as an unofficial Wimbledon title, but she did make her All-England début that same year, 1909, and reached the singles quarter-final before retiring injured against the eventual champion, Dora Boothby. She managed to reach the Wimbledon semi-final three times but all ended in defeat; by Edith Hannam in 1911, Dorothea Lambert Chambers in 1913 and Elizabeth Ryan of the United States in 1914. 


Helen won a silver medal in the indoor mixed doubles event at the 1912 Olympics with Henry Roper Barrett but lost to fellow Britons Charles Dixon and Helen Hannam after winning the first set. She made up for that disappointment the following year when she beat the four-times French champion Kate Gillou in straight sets to win the World Covered Court championship at Stockholm. Helen married John Leisk in 1914 and continued playing under her married name and in 1922 was runner-up in the Welsh championship and also competed at Roehampton and, for the last time, at Wimbledon, where she reached the ladies doubles semi-final.

Roper Barrett learned his tennis at Merchant Taylor’s School and the Forest Gate Club and was able to devote a great deal of time to the game. He won the Belgian Open singles title for four successive years from 1900, the Austrian title in 1904 and a vast number of tournaments at home. He was most successful in the Suffolk Championships at Saxmundham which he won no less than 17 times between 1898 and 1921. Barrett also reached the final of the All-comers singles at Wimbledon four times, going through to the Challenge Round in 1911 when he was forced to retire against Tony Wilding with the score level at two sets all. 


Despite these considerable successes, Roper Barett must, in retrospect, be considered as a better doubles player. With his Olympic partner, Arthur “Wentworth” Gore, they made up one of the more formidable doubles combinations of their era, winning Wimbledon in 1909 and reaching the All-Comers final on three other occasions. They won the Olympic covered court title in 1908 and the following year took the British indoor title.


Barrett and Gore went to Stockholm in 1912 to defend their Olympic indoor crown but after winning the first two sets were beaten by a Swedish pair in the semi-finals. Barrett, however, had the consolation of winning a silver medal in the mixed doubles with Helen Aitchison as his partner. Apart from his win at Wimbledon with Gore in 1909, Barrett was also successful in 1912 and 1913 when he was partnered with Charles Dixon, who, like Barrett, was a solicitor by profession. Additionally, he won the covered court mixed doubles in 1910 with Mrs. O’Neill. Roper Barrett played in the first Davis cup match at Boston in 1900 with his last appearance coming in 1919. Although he did not have a particularly distinguished playing record in Cup matches he did, as non-playing captain, lead the British team to four consecutive victories in the thirties. Barrett served as Chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association in 1924 and was active in civic affairs, being twice Master of the Worshipful Company of Farriers and Chief Commoner of the City of London in 1924. He was also a keen footballer, playing regularly for Corinthians Casuals at Weybridge.

Beamish and Parke reached the All-comer’s final again in 1913 but lost in three sets to the German pair of  Heinrich Kleinschroth and Friedrich Rahe. His best finish in the mixed doubles was in reaching the semi-final, with his wife Geraldine in 1920, and with Ethel Larcombe a year later.


Partnering Charles Dixon, Beamish won the bronze medal in the covered court doubles event at the 1912 Olympics. It was his only Olympic medal despite competing in five events at the 1912 and 1920 Games. Beamish made three appearances in the Davis Cup in 1911, 1912 and 1920 and was a member of the winning British Isles team that beat Australasia in 1912. Also in 1912 he was runner-up in the forerunner of the Australian Open, when he lost to his doubles partner James Parke. Beamish was also the runner-up in the Irish championship in 1909 and 1910. After the War, in which Beamish served in France with the Army Service Corps, Beamish reached the final of the world covered court championship at København in 1921 but lost to William Laurentz in straight sets. His wife Geraldine, who he married in 1911, won the women’s doubles silver medal at the 1912 Olympics and was beaten in the ladies’ doubles final at Wimbledon in 1921, but did win five titles at the world covered court championships between 1919-23.

Dora Köring played tennis at the 1912 Olympics, winning a silver in singles and a gold medal in mixed doubles, alongside Heinrich Schomburgk. She won the second German female Olympic gold medal in Olympic history. During the singles final she was leading Marguerite Broquedis when Broquedis left the court to change her shoes. This tactical maneuver took Köring completely out of rhythm, and she went on to lose the match. Köring was the 1912-13 German Champion in singles. She later played a professional tour in 1927 against Suzanne Lenglen, without much success. Köring died in World War II when her house was bombed during the Dresden bombing raids.

In tennis he was German singles champion in 1913, won doubles titles in 1908, 1910, and 1921, and won mixed doubles titles in 1912-13 and 1921. Schomburgk competed at Wimbledon in 1903, losing in the third round of singles and the second round of doubles. He participated in the 1908 London and the 1912 Stockholm Games. In London he was eliminated early in the singles and reached the eighth finals in the doubles with Otto Froitzheim. In Stockholm he earned the gold medal in the mixed together with Dora Köring. In the singles and the doubles with Otto von Müller he again reached the eighth finals.


Schomburgk’s brother Wilhelm, a lawyer, became President of the Deutscher Tennis Bund in the 1930s. Wilhelm was the founder of the club championship matches for senior players of the German Tennis Federation, the Große Schomburgk-Spiele, which are still played today.

Marguerite Broquedis played in the 1912 Olympics, winning two medals, and returned to the Olympics in 1924, after her marriage, as Mrs. Billout. She won her 1912 singles gold medal by a bit of gamesmanship: when trailing she left the court to change her shoes, and after returning, her opponent Dora Köring was completely out of rhythm and lost the match. Broquedis was French ladies’ singles champion in 1913-14, won the ladies’ doubles in 1924, with Yvonne Bourgeois, and was mixed doubles champion in 1911, with André Gobert, and 1924, with Jean Borotra.  All of those championships were won when the French title was a closed competition. In 1927 she won what is considered her only Grand Slam title when, by then as Mrs. Bordes, she and Borotra won the French mixed doubles after it had become an open competition. Broquedis also won the 1912 World Hard Court Title, which was, at that time, played on clay. Indoors she won multiple French titles – ladies’ singles in 1910, 1912-13, 1922, 1925, and 1927; ladies’ doubles in 1925, with Bourgeois; and mixed doubles in 1913 (with William Laurentz) and 1922 and 1925 with Borotra.


Termed ""The Goddess"" for her pinup looks, Broquedis is actually best known as the last player to have defeated Suzanne Lenglen in a full match, which she did in May 1914 in the French Closed Final. Lenglen was only 15-years-old at the time and lost only one other known match, when she withdrew from illness in 1921 while playing Molla Bjurstedt-Mallory.

After their scare in the semi-finals, Hillyard and Doherty were relieved to take the gold medals in straight sets. At the time of his Olympic victory, Hillyard was 44 years old and had been married to Blanche Bingley, six-times winner of the Wimbledon singles, for 21 years. He was in the second year of his 17-year tenure as the Secretary of the All-England Club and his best playing years were already behind him. He had won the English covered courts doubles in 1890 and 1891 with Harry Scrivener and again in 1904 and 1905 with Laurie Doherty as his partner. Hillyard’s outstanding achievement outdoors was to win the German Championship in 1897 and 1898 when this was still one of the major international tournaments.


As a young man, George Hillyard spent some time in the navy and served on the same ship as the Price of Wales. He developed a close personal friendship with the future King George V, the basis on which the still surviving interest of the Royal family in lawn tennis is founded. Upon the outbreak of war, Hillyard rejoined the Navy and rose to the rank of Commander. Hillyard also excelled as a golfer and in 1903 he defeated Harry Hilton, the Open champion of 1892 and 1897 and the reigning amateur champion. It was, however, cricket and not golf that was really George Hillyard’s second sport. He played for Leicestershire, Middlesex, and the Gentlemen of England and went with Lord Hawke’s team to America in 1891 and 1894.

No tennis player in history has won more Olympic medals than Great Britain’s Reginald Doherty. But he is also remembered for withdrawing from the semi-finals at Paris 1900 to give his brother Laurence a better chance of claiming the singles title.


Tennis therapy


British lawn tennis player Reginald “R.F.” Frank Doherty was born in 1872 in Wimbledon, the spiritual home of lawn tennis, and was steered towards the sport from an early age by his father, who saw it as a way of improving his son’s poor health. He was joined by his younger brother Laurie, whose equally impressive skills on the court were an additional source of motivation. Together, the pair would go on to dominate the international tennis scene from the end of the 19th century to the early years of the 20th century.


Wimbledon aces


Known for his high-quality all-round game, a blistering serve, and a deft and graceful touch, the older Doherty brother won his first Wimbledon singles title in 1897 and then defended it three times in the three years that followed. He also triumphed at the 1902 US Open in New York, and with Laurie at his side, he collected eight men’s doubles titles at Wimbledon between 1897 and 1905. The talented siblings, who together wrote one of the first books related to tennis technique (R.F. and H.L. Doherty on Lawn Tennis, published in 1903), also represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup, lifting the prestigious trophy on four occasions, in 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906.


Brothers in arms


At the Olympic tennis competition on the Ile de Puteaux courts in Paris (FRA) in 1900, the Dohertys each reached the semi-finals of the singles, where they were scheduled to play each other. However, believing that his younger brother stood a better chance of beating Harold Mahony (GBR) in the final, R.F stepped aside and settled for a bronze medal. Laurie took advantage of this act of brotherly kindness, defeating Mahoney 6-4 6-2 6-3 to become Olympic champion. R.F. enjoyed a highly successful Olympic tournament nonetheless, partnering up with compatriot Charlotte Cooper in the mixed doubles to beat Mahony and Hélène Prévost (FRA) 6-2 6-2 in the final, and picking up a second title with his brother in the men’s doubles by overwhelming Basil Spalding de Garmendia (USA) and Max Décugis (FRA) in three sets (6-1 6-1 6-0).


Grass roots


Ranked number one in the world between 1897 and 1902, before being replaced by his brother (who reigned from 1903 to 1906), R.F. Doherty did not compete in the St. Louis Games in 1904, but returned to the courts at London 1908. On the Wimbledon grass that he knew so well, he teamed up with countryman George Hillyard in the doubles to secure a third Olympic gold medal, overcoming another British pair, Clement Cazalet and Charles Dixon, in five sets on 11 July 1908.


Ailing health


R.F. Doherty had suffered from respiratory problems since childhood, and just two years after his London success, his health began to decline. The Englishman travelled to Davos, in Switzerland, to convalesce, but returned to Britain, where he died of a heart attack at the age of 38 on 29 December 1910. In 1980, both Doherty brothers were inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

Major Ritchie learned his tennis on the family court at home in Putney but when he went to Brighton College he chose not to specialize in the game remaining active in many sports most notably as a particularly fine gymnast. It was not until early in 1892 that Ritchie, by then aged 21, began to take lawn tennis seriously. Seven years later, he won the French covered courts singles championship and from then on he compiled an impressive record of success both at home and on the Continent. At the 1908 Olympics, with Ritchie meeting the German, Otto Froitzheim, in the final the 22-year-old German surprisingly elected to take on Ritchie, 15 years his senior, from the baseline. Ritchie had few peers at this type of game and as Froitzheim was not one of them he lost to the English veteran in straight sets. Ritchie also won an Olympic silver medal in the doubles with James Parke as his partner and earlier in the same year had won a bronze in the covered court doubles. Major Ritchie won the Wimbledon doubles in 1908 and 1910, partnering the New Zealander, Tony Wilding, with his best performance in the Wimbledon singles coming in 1909 when he won through to the Challenge round only to lose to Wentworth Gore in five sets. His son, Richard, was also an accomplished player but became better known for having served as Secretary of the Queen’s Club for some 30 years.

James Parke was one of Ireland's best allround sportsmen. He was first selected for the Irish national rugby team while still a student at Trinity College. Eventually he won 20 caps as a centre between 1903 and 1909, scoring 36 points including 2 tries, with a record 5 penalties in one of them. Parke then quit rugby and switched his attention to tennis. At that point, he had already won an Olympic silver medal (in the doubles) as well as a few Irish Championships. He developed into one of the best players in the world - ranked 4th in the 1920 ranking by The Daily Telegraph. He won the Australian Open singles and doubles titles in 1912, and the doubles at Wimbledon two years later. He played 20 times for the British Davis Cup team, winning the Cup against Australasia after a crucial win by Parkes over top player Norman Brookes. Parke, who always pinned a shamrock to his shirt when playing again stood in the Davis Cup final the following year, winning both his singles matches while his team lost the tie. Besides his activities in rugby and tennis, Parke also excelled in cricket and golf (representing Ireland), and was a decent sprinter on the track.

Clement Cazalet was one of 10 children, but only son, born to wealthy businessman and Surrey JP, William Cazalet. Clement was privately educated before attending Rugby school and then going to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1887. The following year he made the first of his 16 appearances at Wimbledon between then and 1919. His best performance in the singles was in 1896 when he lost to Wilberforce Eaves in the quarter-final and in 1906 he reached the same stage before losing to Sidney Smith. He reached the all-comers doubles final on three occasions, in 1897, 1902 and 1906 and in the second of those years, Cazalet and George Hillyard led Sidney Smith and Frank Riseley two sets to one before losing 3-2.


One of his best individual performances was in beating Josiah Ritchie to win the all-comers final of the South of England championship in 1902 before losing to Sidney Smith.  At the 1908 London Olympics Cazalet won the bronze medal in the men’s doubles with Charles Dixon. He served as a Major with the Red Cross Society and Order of St John as a voluntary driver during World War I and won the British War Medal, Victory Medal and 1914 Star. He was mentioned in despatches and obtained a DSO in 1917. He later worked as a marine engineer and was involved in the laying of cables across both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 


Cazalet continued playing tennis into the late 1920s and competed in the Eastbourne tournament in 1928 at the age of 59. His second wife Mildred was also a competitive tennis player and they took part in many top tournaments together, notably in the 1925 Cromer covered court championship when they lost to the crack French duo of Jacques Brugnon and Suzanne Lenglen. Cazalet was a member of the Renelagh Club and played golf for them well into his 60s and in 1932 he had the honour of captaining the Great Britain seniors golf team on their tour of North America when they played matches against the United States and Canada.

In an all-British final, Charles Dixon and Edith Hannam beat Roper Barrett and Helen Aitchison to take the mixed doubles covered court title at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm. Mrs. Hannam had earlier won the women’s singles and Dixon had already made his mark on the tournament with an outstanding win over the reigning Wimbledon champion, Tony Wilding of New Zealand, in the semi-finals of the men’s singles. In the singles final, Dixon went down in straight sets to André Gobert of France but completed his set of Olympic medals by wining a bronze in the men’s doubles. Charles Dixon reached the All-Comers final of the singles at Wimbledon in 1901 and 1911 but he did not win a Wimbledon title until two months after the 1912 Olympics when the 39-year-old veteran won the Wimbledon doubles with Roper Barrett. He then took the 1912 Australian doubles title with James Parke and concluded a memorable year by captaining the team which recaptured the Davis Cup from Australasia. In 1913 Dixon and Roper Barrett successfully defended their Wimbledon title. Charles Dixon was educated at Haileybury and Clare College, Cambridge before becoming a solicitor. He played in four Davis Cup ties and while at Cambridge won a blue for Rackets, but surprisingly, not for lawn tennis. He was also a scratch golfer and his sporting talents were shared by his brother, John, who captained Nottinghamshire at cricket for many years and won an England cap at soccer.

The covered court singles matches at the 1908 Olympic Games began at the Queen's Club immediately after the English Championships had been held on the same courts. Regrettably, the Olympic tournament drew a poor entry and Wentworth Gore had had to play on two singles matches to add an Olympic gold medal to the English title he had won the previous week. In the first match, Gore came from behind to beat Josiah Ritchie, who later in the summer won the Olympic outdoor title, and in the final the 40-year-old Gore was relieved to beat George Caridia in straight sets after his five set opening match.


With Roper Barrett as his partner, Gore won a second Olympic gold in the indoor's men doubles thereby confirming their position as one of the leading doubles pairings of the day. They reached the Wimbledon All-Comers in 1899 and 1908 before winning the Challenge Round in 1909 when they also won the British covered courts title. But possible their greatest victory came on the only occasional they played together in the Davis Cup. In the 1907 Challenge round, Gore and Barrett lost the first two sets to the Australasian pair, Norman Brookes and Tony Wilding, but after squaring the match they took the final set 13-11.


In 1900, Gore beat the great Laurie Doherty at Dublin, Beckenham and Wimbledon and was honored with the captaincy of Britain's first Davis Cup team. The following year he won the first of his three Wimbledon singles titles. Despite his many successes, it is really the longevity of his career that places Wentworth Gore among the lawn tennis immortals. He played at every Wimbledon from 1888 to 1927, a remarkable span of 39 years; he is the oldest winner of the Wimbledon singles (aged 41 in 1909) and he also holds the record of being the oldest Wimbledon singles finalist (aged 44 in 1912). Wentworth Gore learned his tennis on the sand courts of Brittany and although many sources indicate that he was educated at Harrow this is incorrect and he was, in fact, educated abroad.

Roper Barrett learned his tennis at Merchant Taylor’s School and the Forest Gate Club and was able to devote a great deal of time to the game. He won the Belgian Open singles title for four successive years from 1900, the Austrian title in 1904 and a vast number of tournaments at home. He was most successful in the Suffolk Championships at Saxmundham which he won no less than 17 times between 1898 and 1921. Barrett also reached the final of the All-comers singles at Wimbledon four times, going through to the Challenge Round in 1911 when he was forced to retire against Tony Wilding with the score level at two sets all. 


Despite these considerable successes, Roper Barett must, in retrospect, be considered as a better doubles player. With his Olympic partner, Arthur “Wentworth” Gore, they made up one of the more formidable doubles combinations of their era, winning Wimbledon in 1909 and reaching the All-Comers final on three other occasions. They won the Olympic covered court title in 1908 and the following year took the British indoor title.


Barrett and Gore went to Stockholm in 1912 to defend their Olympic indoor crown but after winning the first two sets were beaten by a Swedish pair in the semi-finals. Barrett, however, had the consolation of winning a silver medal in the mixed doubles with Helen Aitchison as his partner. Apart from his win at Wimbledon with Gore in 1909, Barrett was also successful in 1912 and 1913 when he was partnered with Charles Dixon, who, like Barrett, was a solicitor by profession. Additionally, he won the covered court mixed doubles in 1910 with Mrs. O’Neill. Roper Barrett played in the first Davis cup match at Boston in 1900 with his last appearance coming in 1919. Although he did not have a particularly distinguished playing record in Cup matches he did, as non-playing captain, lead the British team to four consecutive victories in the thirties. Barrett served as Chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association in 1924 and was active in civic affairs, being twice Master of the Worshipful Company of Farriers and Chief Commoner of the City of London in 1924. He was also a keen footballer, playing regularly for Corinthians Casuals at Weybridge.

The son of a Swiss-born London banker George Simond also worked in the city as a Bill broker. Three of his brothers, Charles, Septimus and Amadee, who died at the age of 36, were also good standard competitive tennis players. Charles and George both made their Wimbledon débuts in 1894. A regular at the All-England Club between then and 1912, George reached the singles quarter-final in his début year and reached the last eight four times in his first five appearances. He also regularly reached the men’s doubles quarter-finals and went one better on two occasions, reaching the semi-final, firstly in 1901 when he was partnered by Herbert Roper Barrett but they lost to the American pair of Dwight Davis and Holcombe Ward, and again in 1906 when Simond and Clement Cazalet lost in four sets to British compatriots Frank Riseley and Sidney Smith.


George Simond won the silver medal in the covered court men’s doubles event at the 1908 Olympics with George Caridia but lost the final in four sets to Herbert Roper Barrett and Arthur Wentworth Gore. In the first round they came from two sets down to beat fellow Britons George Hillyard and Wilberforce Eaves in a grueling five-setter. Prior to his Olympic appearance Simond had  twice won the French Indoor title, in 1898 and 1901, but he could not win  the British covered court title, losing the final in 1901 and 1902 to Laurie Doherty and Josiah Ritchie respectively. George enjoyed his finest year in 1905 when he won the Swiss International, Lyon indoor and Middlesex championships. He died at his Monte Carlo home in 1941.

Caridia made his Wimbledon début in 1898 and reached the men’s doubles semi-final with George Simond, a performance the pair repeated 12 months later. Caridia’s best performance in the singles was also in reaching the semi-final of the all-comers competition in 1903 when he lost to Josiah Ritchie. He played in the Welsh covered court championship at Llandudno for more than 20 years and won the title nine times between 1899-1909, and he was still playing in the tournament in the mid-1920s. Although he won the Welsh title nine times, his best performance was probably in winning the French covered court title in 1900. He twice got beat in the final of all-comers competition at the British covered court championship; by Josiah Ritchie in 1905 and by Tony Wilding in 1907. 


Caridia won two silver medals in covered court events at the 1908 Olympics.

Fenning, who was also a member of the London Rowing Club, was a medical student at London Hospital at the time of his Olympic victory but he did not qualify as a doctor until 1917. He had entered London Hospital Medical College in January 1904 and the records of London Hospital indicate that “his prolonged, 13-year medical course was the result of failing examinations rather than war service.” When he eventually qualified, the 32-year-old Dr. John Fenning initially practiced in the Home Counties but he moved to the Midlands in 1937 where he spent the rest of his life.

Although born and originally educated in Australia, Eric Fairbairn moved to London with his family, and was sent to Eton College. After going up to Jesus College, Cambridge, he followedthe family rowing tradition, as his uncle Steven Fairbairn was a four-time Cambridge Blue, and was responsible for developing the “Fairbairn Style” of rowing. Eric won his Blue in 1908, when he rowed at number four in the Cambridge crew that won in the fastest time since 1902. He was scheduled to win his second Blue in 1909 but had to pull out due to an injury a week before the race. He did, however, win that second Blue in 1911 but sadly Oxford won the race in a time of 18:29, which was not bettered until 1934.


Selected for the Great Britain eights at the 1908 Olympics, for reasons unknown he lost his place in the boat and was replaced by fellow Jesus man, and former Cambridge President, Henry Goldsmith. The eight won the bronze medal while Fairbairn won the silver in the coxless pairs after teaming up with Philip Verdon. Shortly before the Olympics, Fairbairn won the Senior Sculls Challenge Cup at the Marlow Regatta. Fairbairn rowed at stroke in the Jesus College crew beaten in the final of the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley by the Belgian Royal Club Nautique de Gand in 1909 and, the following year, Jesus were beaten in the final again, this time by Magdalen, Oxford. Fairbairn was also a first class rugby player and often wore the colours of Rosslyn Park RUFC.


The day after World War I broke out, Fairbairn enlisted before obtaining a commission into the 10th battalion, Durham Light Infantry. He was sent to France on 22 May 1915 and, a month later, was badly injured while fighting on the front line, when hit by shrapnel from a grenade. He died from his wounds later that same day.

However, on going up to Trinity College, Cambridge Pennell failed to find a place in the University racquets team and began to take more interest in the game of Real Tennis. Although he was undoubtedly one of the outstanding players of court games of his generation, Vane Pennell only made occasional appearances in the championship events. In 1901 he was the British racquets doubles champion, partnering a fellow Old Carthusian, Frances Dames Longworth, but Pennell did not play in the championships again until 1908 when he and Dames Longworth again won the title. His appearances in the Real Tennis championships were equally spasmodic and he only entered for the single nine times in the twenty-year period up to 1923. He was, however, a finalist seven times and won the title in 1904. At the 1908 Olympics, Pennell played in the singles at both real tennis and racquets and in each event was defeated by the ultimate winner.

However, he competed in the racquets tournament at the 1908 London Olympics and was good enough to win two medals, a bronze in the doubles with Evan Noel and a silver in the singles when he was forced to withdraw from the final against Noel with an injured arm.


Leaf was educated at Marlborough and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a racquets Blue in 1883, winning the doubles with John Cobbold, who was a member of the famous Suffolk Brewing family. Leaf was Blue again in 1894 but was this time beaten in the doubles. Henry studied engineering and obtained his technical education at Cambridge and the University College, London. He became a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1889 and worked on major electric lighting and power contracts in Göteborg, Sweden; Le Mans in France and in the United Kingdom. In 1907 he wrote a revolutionary book entitled The Internal Wiring of Buildings.


When the Corps of Electrical Engineers was formed in 1897 Leaf was a founding member and served in the Boer War in South Africa. He also served with the R. N. D. Motor Transport Company in France during the Great War. He was wounded, awarded the D. S. O., and mentioned in despatches.


Leaf himself was a member of Queen’s Club and carried on playing racquets beyond his 60th birthday. He also played a large part in establishing the Tennis and Racquets Association in its early days. The Henry Leaf Cup was presented by him in 1922 and is goes to the winner of the Old Boys Schools Racquets Championship. Leaf was also a fine cricketer and captained the Free Foresters on many occasions.


Leaf was killed in an accident in 1931 when hit by a bus in Cockspur Street, Trafalgar Square. Ironically, at the time of his death he was a member of the Auxiliary Bus Companies’ Association, a group of old colleagues who drove buses in France, and he was known to most drivers in London, including the one driving the bus that was to kill him.

Evan Noel, the 1907 Amateur racquets champion, qualified to meet Henry Leaf in the 1908 Olympic singles final but Leaf had injured his hand in the semi-final against John Jacob Astor and was obliged to withdraw. Noel thus won the first gold medal to be awarded at the 1908 Olympics on a walkover. As a losing semi-finalist, he also won a bronze medal in the doubles and later played in the Olympic Real Tennis tournament where he was eliminated in the first round. Evan Noel, who was ambidextrous but favored the left hand, was educated at Winchester and Trinity College, Cambridge where, in addition to his talents for court games, he proved himself to be a fine cricketer, playing in the Winchester XI for three years and later captaining Trinity. A year after leaving Cambridge in 1901, he was admitted to the Inner temple and in 1903 he took up the post sports editor of The Times but, acting on advice from his doctor that night work on a newspaper would be detrimental to his fragile health, in 1909 he resigned. In 1914, Noel, the leading historian of court games, was appointed secretary and manager of the Queen’s Club and held this position until his death 14 years later.

John Mulcahy was the first U.S. Olympic rower to win a national title, having taken the double sculls in 1891 with M. F. Monahan. Rowing for the Atalanta BC in New York, where he served as club president, he added another in 1904, partnered by Bill Varley in the Olympic doubles, which also served as the NAAO (National Association of Amateur Oarsmen) Championships that year. He graduated from Fordham in 1894, and later was a football coach at Seton Hall University, beginning in 1905. In 1910 he left Seton Hall and returned to Fordham where he was the school’s first rowing coach. He later worked for many years as manager of the Midvale Steel Company of Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Mulcahy was inducted in the National Rowing Hall of Fame in 1956 and the Fordham Athletic Hall of Fame in 1991.

In 1869, Harry Wright, the English-born son of a cricket professional, formed the first professional baseball team in America. Harry Wright was the player-manager of the Cincinnati Red Stockings and included on the team was his younger brother, George, who drew the then-record salary of $1,400 for the season. As the popularity of pro baseball increased, George Wright was to earn much more than this and prospered sufficiently to send his son, Beals, to Harvard. Beals Wright was to become one of the leading players in the early days of lawn tennis in America, but surprisingly he never won his letter at Harvard. He was America’s first Olympic lawn tennis champion, winning the singles and doubles (with Edgar Leonard) in 1904. These two Olympics titles came relatively early in his career although three years previously he had been runner-up in the U.S. singles. Beals Wright was destined to be runner-up on four other occasions, but in 1905 he took the national title by beating Holcombe Ward, a fellow Harvardian. Wright and Ward won the doubles for three straight years (1904-1906) and in 1910, at the age of 30, the left-handed Wright became the first American to reach the final of the All-Comer’s singles at Wimbledon, where he lost to the New Zealander, Tony Wilding, who went on to win the Challenge Round. Apart from these successes, Wright will also be remembered for his contribution to the Davis Cup squad. He was on the team in 1905, 1907, 1908, and 1911 and although the U.S. reached the Challenge Round in three of those years, they never succeeded in winning the Cup. They lost by only three matches to two in 1908 against Australasia in Melbourne, and Wright’s magnificent victories over Tony Wilding and Norman Brooks put the U.S. within an ace of winning the tie. In his later years, Wright maintained his keen interest in the sport and served a term as president of the USLTA.

Together with his Harvard classmate, Beals Wright, Edgar Leonard took the 1904 Olympic doubles title, losing only one set in the four matches they played. In the singles that year, Leonard lost in the semi-finals to the eventual runner-up, Robert LeRoy. Leonard graduated Harvard in 1903 after having captained the tennis team and having shared the intercollegiate doubles title in 1902. He never won a national championship, but in 1903 he achieved his highest national ranking of eighth. Leonard became a very successful businessman in a number of different fields. After college he helped his father run the family wool business, but in 1915 Leonard settled in New York, where he helped establish the brokerage firm of Moore, Leonard, & Lynch. This was his primary occupation for the rest of his life although he served on the board of several companies. During these years Leonard occupied his leisure hours with court tennis and polo.

Apart from Beals Wright, Robert LeRoy was the most successful lawn tennis player at the 1904 Olympics, winning two silver medals. LeRoy played in the Olympic tennis event while a student at Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1905. He later went on to Columbia Law, earning his LL.B. in 1908. It was at law that LeRoy did his life’s work, mainly with the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham, and Taft on Wall Street. LeRoy never won a national tennis championship, but was three times ranked among America’s top ten players, reaching as high as fifth in 1907. His wife, née Grace Arnold Moore, was also a fine player, winning the women’s championship several times at the West Side Tennis Club in Queens, New York. Robert LeRoy was instrumental, in 1923, in establishing the Museum of the City of New York. He served as secretary and trustee of that institution until his death.

He won the first of his three Southern California singles titles in 1900 and was on the winning doubles team three times. He was ranked nationally only once when, in 1904, he was placed ninth in the singles ratings. At the Olympics he was awarded joint third place in the singles after losing to the eventual champion, Beals Wright, in the semi-finals.

Wear was the U.S. court tennis doubles champion five times (with Jay Gould ) and won the racquet doubles championship three times. Joseph Wear continued to serve the sport of lawn tennis after his playing days were over. He was first vice president of the USLTA (1936-41), chairman of the Davis Cup committee (1928-1931), and non-playing captain of the Davis Cup team in 1935. Apart from their close connection with the Davis Cup, the Wear family also had an association with the Walker Cup – Joseph and Arthur’s sister, Lucretia, married George Herbert Walker, the donor of the trophy which is played for by British and U.S. amateur golfers.

The Doherty brothers, Laurie and Reggie, reigned supreme in the tennis world at the turn of the century and were one of the finest doubles pairings in the history of the game. Both educated at Westminster School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, they won the Wimbledon doubles a record eight times, took he US title twice and were unbeaten in the five Davis Cup rubbers they played together. When they were at their peak, the Doherty’s lost only four of the countless doubles matches they played together.


The younger of the two, Laurie, had slightly the better record as a singles player, winning Wimbledon five times to Reggie’s four and also winning the US singles in 1903, being the only overseas player to do so between 1881 and 1925. Laurie also enjoyed an impeccable record in the Davis Cup, winning all twelve of his rubbers. Reggie won the Wimbledon singles from 1897-1900 and Laurie took the title from 1902-1906, with Arthur “Wentworth” Gore being the only person able to prevent the brothers from completely monopolizing the Championship for a full decade when he beat Reggie in the 1901 Challenge Round. Their feats are commemorated by “The Doherty Gates” at the south-west entrance of the All-England Club.


In the Olympic singles in 1900, Laurie Doherty was scheduled to meet Reggie in the semi-finals but Reggie conceded a walkover so that Laurie met the Irishman, Harold Mahony, in the final. Mahony reputedly had the best volley and the worst forehand in the game and at times this was clearly an adequate enough combination as Mahony had won the 1896 Wimbledon singles. But in Paris, Mahony’s assets and liabilities failed to meet the searching demands of Doherty’s audit and the Englishman won the gold medal in straight sets.


Laurie won a second gold medal in the men’s doubles with Reggie as his partner. The 1900 Official Report indicates that the scratch pairing of Max Décugis (FRA) and Spalding de Garmendia (USA) gave the Doherty’s a good match before losing 6-3, 6-3, 7-5, but The Field reported that the British pair had a rather more comfortable victory at 6-1, 6-1, 6-0. Laurie also played in the Mixed Doubles at the 1900 Olympics with the American, Marion Jones, as his partner but they were beaten in the semi-finals by Reggie and Charlotte Cooper, winner of the Women’s singles.


After poor healthy forced Laurie to retire from top class tennis in 1906 he turned to golf and with a handicap of plus two at Royal St. George’s he played several times in the Amateur Championship. His best performance was on his home course in 1908 when he reached the last sixteen. In 1914, Laurie Doherty joined the Royal Naval Reserve but the rigors of service in an anti-aircraft unit hastened the breakdown of his delicate constitution and he died, aged 43, after a long illness.

No tennis player in history has won more Olympic medals than Great Britain’s Reginald Doherty. But he is also remembered for withdrawing from the semi-finals at Paris 1900 to give his brother Laurence a better chance of claiming the singles title.


Tennis therapy


British lawn tennis player Reginald “R.F.” Frank Doherty was born in 1872 in Wimbledon, the spiritual home of lawn tennis, and was steered towards the sport from an early age by his father, who saw it as a way of improving his son’s poor health. He was joined by his younger brother Laurie, whose equally impressive skills on the court were an additional source of motivation. Together, the pair would go on to dominate the international tennis scene from the end of the 19th century to the early years of the 20th century.


Wimbledon aces


Known for his high-quality all-round game, a blistering serve, and a deft and graceful touch, the older Doherty brother won his first Wimbledon singles title in 1897 and then defended it three times in the three years that followed. He also triumphed at the 1902 US Open in New York, and with Laurie at his side, he collected eight men’s doubles titles at Wimbledon between 1897 and 1905. The talented siblings, who together wrote one of the first books related to tennis technique (R.F. and H.L. Doherty on Lawn Tennis, published in 1903), also represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup, lifting the prestigious trophy on four occasions, in 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906.


Brothers in arms


At the Olympic tennis competition on the Ile de Puteaux courts in Paris (FRA) in 1900, the Dohertys each reached the semi-finals of the singles, where they were scheduled to play each other. However, believing that his younger brother stood a better chance of beating Harold Mahony (GBR) in the final, R.F stepped aside and settled for a bronze medal. Laurie took advantage of this act of brotherly kindness, defeating Mahoney 6-4 6-2 6-3 to become Olympic champion. R.F. enjoyed a highly successful Olympic tournament nonetheless, partnering up with compatriot Charlotte Cooper in the mixed doubles to beat Mahony and Hélène Prévost (FRA) 6-2 6-2 in the final, and picking up a second title with his brother in the men’s doubles by overwhelming Basil Spalding de Garmendia (USA) and Max Décugis (FRA) in three sets (6-1 6-1 6-0).


Grass roots


Ranked number one in the world between 1897 and 1902, before being replaced by his brother (who reigned from 1903 to 1906), R.F. Doherty did not compete in the St. Louis Games in 1904, but returned to the courts at London 1908. On the Wimbledon grass that he knew so well, he teamed up with countryman George Hillyard in the doubles to secure a third Olympic gold medal, overcoming another British pair, Clement Cazalet and Charles Dixon, in five sets on 11 July 1908.


Ailing health


R.F. Doherty had suffered from respiratory problems since childhood, and just two years after his London success, his health began to decline. The Englishman travelled to Davos, in Switzerland, to convalesce, but returned to Britain, where he died of a heart attack at the age of 38 on 29 December 1910. In 1980, both Doherty brothers were inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

Harold Mahony was born to a wealthy barrister in Scotland, but lived much of his life in Ireland. His father had a tennis court built at their home at Dromore Castle in County Kerry, Ireland, where Mahony learned the game. He made his début at Wimbledon in 1890, losing in the first round. In 1891 he reached the semi-finals of the All-Comers Event, repeating that finish in 1892. In 1893 he made it to the All-Comers final, losing there to Joshua Pim. After losing in the second round in 1894, he skipped the 1895 event, but in 1896 came through to become Wimbledon Champion, defeating Wilfred Baddeley in the final, 6-2, 6-8, 5-7, 8-6, 6-3, the longest Wimbledon men’s final until 1954 when Jaroslav Drobný defeated Ken Rosewall. Mahony competed at Wimbledon through 1904, making the All-Comers final again in 1898, also winning the Irish title that year, but he never won another major. In 1905, Mahony went for a bicycle ride and never returned from it. His body and broken bike were found at the base of a steep hill near his County Kerry castle.

In winning the women’s tennis singles title at Paris 1900, Charlotte Cooper became the first female athlete to win Olympic gold in an individual event.


A record breaker


Charlotte Cooper was one of the great women’s tennis champions of the late 19th-century, a time when the ladies’ game was played in long dresses. A member of the Ealing Lawn Tennis Club, Cooper won her first Wimbledon singles title in 1895, aged 25, and would go on to repeat the feat on four further occasions. She was a wife and a mother by the time she won the last of those titles, in 1908, when she became the oldest winner of the prestigious tournament at the age of 37 years and 296 days, a record that stands to this day. Her 11 singles finals between 1895 and 1912 represented another Wimbledon record, which she held outright until 1994, when it was equalled by Martina Navratilova.


Fun and games in Paris


Also known as Les concours internationaux d'exercices physiques et de sports, the 1900 Paris Olympic Games took place between mid-May and late October, and were held as part of the city’s Exposition Universelle (World Fair). Women made their first appearance on the Olympic stage, competing in archery, sailing, equestrianism, croquet, boules, life-saving, fishing, golf and tennis. Held in July, the tennis tournament took place on clay courts installed in the rural surroundings of the Ile de Puteaux, in the middle of the Seine, with Cooper entering the women’s singles and the mixed doubles.


History in the making


One of the few female players at the time to serve overarm, Cooper was a superb volleyer and played an attacking game, rushing up to the net at every opportunity. She collected her first gold medal of the Games in the mixed doubles with her compatriot R.F. Doherty, the pair beating Hélène Prévost of France and Great Britain’s Harold Mahony 6-2, 6-4 in the final.


Cooper dominated the women’s singles, winning all her matches in straight sets. After accounting for the USA’s Marion Jones 6-2, 7-5 in the semi-final, she got the better of Prévost once more in the final on 11 July, winning 6-1, 6-4 to become the first woman to win Olympic gold in an individual event.


A life devoted to tennis


Cooper continued to compete at the highest level for a number of years after the Paris Games, contesting her last Wimbledon singles final in 1912, by which time she had turned 42. She went on to appear in the women’s doubles final with Dorothea Douglas the following year, a full 18 years after her maiden singles triumph. The sprightly Cooper continued to play the game she loved right through to the 1950s, and died at home in Helensburgh, Scotland, on 10 October 1966 at the age of 96.
